0. Fix up Makefiles as they have been very crudely converted from
   a proprietary make system.

1. Convert make.config to a GNU configure setup

2. Make build of wrappers (java, php, perl) conditional on configure

3. Create proper install scripts/process

4. run scripts for daemontools, rc.d, etc

5. Make all paths in test programs and scripts be driven by
   configuration - such as perl, php, svc

6. Complete HOWTO.run sections
