0. To compile and install is the usual:

   ./configure && make && sudo make install

   If configure fails, it probably means that you are missing
   prerequisite packages. If the compile fails, file a bug report.

   To see if it looks like it's going to work, you can do a trial run
   from the build directory.

   a) Create a configuration for the echo service:

   echo 'exec /usr/local/pluton/libexec/echo_service' >/tmp/system.echo.0.raw

   b) Start the manager:

   cd /tmp
   /usr/local/pluton/bin/plutonManager

   c) From another shell, try and ping the "echo" service:

   /usr/local/pluton/bin/plPing -L /tmp/lookup.map -c5

   The output should be something like this:

   0 bytes: seq=1/0 time=0.004629
   0 bytes: seq=2/0 time=0.000105
   0 bytes: seq=3/0 time=0.000070
   0 bytes: seq=4/0 time=0.000073
   0 bytes: seq=5/0 time=0.000111

1. Prerequisite Packages

   a) Pluton needs the state threads library (libst).

   b) If you want to use the "curl" service you'll need to install the
      curl library (libcurl). (currently the build insists on this
      package as "curl" is the archetypal service).

   c) If you want to run the manager under damontools, then you need
      to install that package too.


2. From sources:

   a) http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/

      Depending on whether and where you install st.h and libst.* you
      make have to tell ./configure where to find it by setting the
      shell variables STATETHREADS_CFLAGS and STATETHREADS_LIBS to
      something like:

      STATETHREADS_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"	\
      STATETHREADS_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lst"		\
      ./configure

   b) http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

      Depending on whether and where you install curl you
      make have to tell ./configure where to find it by setting the
      shell variables LIBCURL_CFLAGS and LIBCURL_LIBS to
      something like:

      LIBCURL_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"	\
      LIBCURL_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lcurl"	\
      ./configure

   c) http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html


3. FreeBSD (7, 8)

   As root:

   a) cd /usr/ports/devel/st && make install

      Note. At the time of writing the ports version of st has a bug -
      buthopefully that is fixed by the time you read this. If not,
      use the "From sources" approach.

   b) cd /usr/ports/ftp/curl && make install
   c) cd /usr/ports/sysutils/daemontools && make install


4. OS/X (10.6, 10.7)

   a) The state threads library has to be installed from sources.

   b) The libcurl library is installed as part of the base package.

   c) If you use the "port" command (see http://www.macports.org),
      then the install command is:

	sudo port install daemontools

      otherwise install from sources.


5. Debian (6.0.2/squeeze)

   a) sudo apt-get install libst-dev
   b) sudo apt-get install libcurl3-dev
   c) apt-get install daemontools daemontools-run
