<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: Overview</h2>

At the core of the Pluton Framework are Service Programs.  Service
Programs are stand-alone executables that accepts requests from
clients via a Unix socket (called a <code>Rendezvous
Socket</code> in Pluton parlance) and send their response back to the client. Service
Programs iterate on this <i>get request/send response</i> sequence
much like a web server. A Service Program is intended to be a
relatively simple program that handles just one type of request, or at
most, a small number of related requests making it relatively easy to
write, test and debug.

<p>
From a client program perspective, the most powerful aspect of the
Pluton Framework is the ease with which multiple service requests can
be made in parallel without needing to resort to the complexities
normally associated with parallel processing such as threads, I/O
event programming or asynchronous I/O.

While there is nothing novel about a Unix socket interface, where the
Pluton Framework comes into play is that it provides:

<ul>
<li>a well documented, simple API for clients to exchange requests with
Service Programs
<li>a well documented, simple API for Service Programs so they can
focus on service provision
<li>a manager program that automatically
instantiates Service Programs based on client demand and a simple
configuration
<li>extensive monitoring and logging of Service Program activity to
simplify performance analysis

</ul>

In short, the Pluton Framework is a comprehensive infrastructure that
frees developers from worrying about the mechanisms and interfaces and
lets them focus on writing Service Programs for their client
applications.

<p>
A key feature of the framework is that clients can easily make
multiple requests in parallel which can greatly reduce client latency
by overlapping requests. This feature is available to all clients
(including PHP) as it does not rely on threads or parallel support
within the client language.

<p>
One scenario where this framework can be particularly useful is a network
application such as a web server that accesses multiple internal
content servers to generate rich output. By making parallel requests
to services, the web application can provide a much lower latency
interface to the user. By virtue of the Service Programs running as
separate executables, the web application is insulated from bugs and
resource leaks that may exist in the service code.

<p>Additional benefits of the framework include:

<ul>
<li>a lighter memory footprint for the web
application since the service code is no longer embedded in the
application
<li>independent resource monitoring of Service Programs
which greatly simplifies performance analysis
<li>simple Service Program testing by virtue of them being
stand-alone executables
<li>interface abstraction across language, OS and network boundaries
<li>simpler install of new features - just an executable and a config
file is required
<li>a substantial reduction in library dependency due to
self-contained executable Service Programs
</ul>

Over time, the hope is that many general purpose Service Programs will
be written thus creating a rich set of building blocks readily
available to every application.
