<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: Commands</h2>

There are a variety of commands associated with the Pluton
Framework. Some are of particular use to developers and QA to send
test requests to a service. The other commands are primarily useful
for testing and administering the <code>plutonManager</code>.

<h3><a name=plPing>plPing: Sends multiple, parallel <em>echo</em>
requests to a service</h3>

The <code>plPing</code> command is primarily intended to see whether the
service infrastructure is running and how long a request takes to travel
through the system. plPing is designed to work in conjunction with the
<code>system.echo.0.raw</code> service.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plPing [-dhKkNnow] [-c count] [-C contextKey=contextValue] [-s packetsize]
                          [-L lookupMap] [-p parallelCount] [-t timeout] [ServiceKey]

Measure the response time of a pluton service

Where:
 -c   Stop after sending 'count' requests (default: infinite)
 -C   Set context with this value (the normal echo service uses this
       as a sleep value)
 -d   Turn on debug
 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
 -i   Wait 'wait' seconds between requests (default: 1)
       If set to zero, this is effectively a ping flood.
 -K   Keep Affinity. Set the 'keepAffinityAttr' attribute
 -k   Send echo a random die request
 -L   The Lookup Map used to connect with the manager (default: '')
 -N   Need Affinity. Set the 'needAffinityAttr' attribute
 -n   Do *not* check the response for a valid echo
 -o   Oneshot. Set the 'noRetryAttr' attribute
 -p   Number of requests to send in parallel (default: 1)
 -s   Size of random data to generate in the request (default: 0)
 -t   Numbers of seconds to wait for a response (default: 5)
 -w   NoWait. Set the 'noWaitAttr' attribute

 ServiceKey: name of service to request (default: system.echo.0.raw)
</pre>

<p>
<code>plPing</code> generates a random request string and sends it to
the service identified by the <code>ServiceKey</code>. The size of the
request string is defined with the <code>-s</code>
option. <code>plPing</code> carefully times the request and produces
latency reports for each request. These latency reports can be used to
understand the latency costs of issuing requests. The latency report
is oblivious to whether a request is relayed to a remote host or not,
the report simply measures the elapse time taken between making the
request and getting a response.

<p>
<code>plPing</code> is designed to work with the
<code>system.echo.0.raw</code> service and it expects the service to
send response data that is exactly the same as the request
data. <code>plPing</code> checks the response data to ensure that it
has been returned exactly as sent. This response data comparison is,
in effect, testing that data encapsulation and exchange through the
system is working properly.

<p>
The <code>-s</code> option can be used to vary the size of the request
and thus measure the latency of the request as the size changes.
<p>
The <code>-p</code> option is used to initiate multiple requests in
parallel and thus exercise and test the parallel aspects of the
framework.

<p>
Example:
<p>
Send a single request to the <code>system.echo.0.raw</code> service
and print out the elapse time required to exchange that request.

<pre>
 $ plPing -c1
</pre>

<h3><a name=plSend>plSend: Send a request and output the response</h3>

The <code>plSend</code> sends user supplied request data to a
nominated service. This program is intended as a convenient tool to
test a service.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plSend [-edhno] [-L lookupMap] [-C name=context .. ]
              [-t timeoutSeconds] ServiceKey [requestString]

Exchange a single request with a pluton service. Print the resulting data
to STDOUT and exit(0) on a successful request, otherwise print the fault
information to STDERR and exit(1).

 -C   Set the context for this request - multiple occurrences ok
 -d   Turn on pluton::client debugging
 -e   Print elapse time of the request to STDERR
 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
 -L   The Lookup Map used to connect with the manager (default: '')
 -n   Append a Newline to the output
 -o   Oneshot. Set the 'noRetryAttr' attribute
 -t   Change the request timeout to 'timeoutSeconds'

 ServiceKey: name of service to request (default: system.echo.0.raw)

 requestString: if present, place this in the requestData. If not present
 read STDIN for the requestData.
</pre>

<p>
Examples:
<p>
Send "Hello World" as the request data with context to
<code>system.echo.0.raw</code> that causes it to sleep for 500
milliseconds.

<pre>
 $ plSend -C echo.sleepMS=500 system.echo.0.raw "Hello World"
</pre>

<p>
Send a pre-constructed request in the "listfolderrequest" file to the
<code>Mail.Folder..XML</code> service and write the response data into
the file "response.data".

<pre>
 $ plSend Mail.Folder..XML &lt;listfolderrequest &gt;results.data
</pre>

<h3><a name=plVersion>plVersion: Print out various version
numbers</h3>

The <code>plVersion</code> command simply prints various versions
numbers associated with the compiled version stamps. It's intended as
a diagnostic tool.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plVersion [-h]

Print out Pluton versions and other static values

 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output:</h4>
<pre>
$ plVersion
plutonManager: $Revision: 260483 $ $Date: 2009-10-16 11:47:56 -0700 (Fri, 16 Oct 2009) $ $Author: markd $ Comp:Mar  8 2007

Lookup Map: /usr/local/var/pluton/lookup.map
shmLookupMapVersion: 1001
shmServiceVersion: 2001
</pre>


<h3><a name=plLookup>plLookup: Lookup a service name and output the
path of the Rendezvous Socket</h3>


<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plLookup [-dhq] [-t timeout] [-L lookupMap] [ServiceKeys...]

Lookup each Service Key and return the path of the Rendezvous Socket

Where:
 -d   Turn on debug output
 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
 -q   Quiet Mode. Do not output the path.
 -L   The Lookup Map used to connect with the manager (default: '')
 -t   Numbers of seconds to keep looking if lookup fails (default: 0)
       The intent of this option is to have plLookup wait until a
       service configuration has been loaded by the Manager.
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output:</h4>
<p>
<pre>
$ bin/plLookup -L lookup.map system.echo.0.raw
Lookup Path: lookup.map
system.echo.0.raw=system.raw.0.echo=/Users/markd/Projects/pluton/system.echo.0.raw.socket
</pre>


<h3><a name=plTest>plTest: Manually test a service program</h3>

<p>
The <code>plTest</code> command runs a service program independently
of the <code>plutonManger</code> and sends a request based on data
from STDIN. As the name implies, it provides a simple way of testing
and debugging services. The response data from the service program is
written to STDOUT and fault information is written to STDERR.

<p><code>plTest</code> relies on the fact that service programs do not
know whether they are run by the
<code>plutonManger</code> of by <code>plTest</code>. In fact
service programs should never attempt to detect the difference.

<p><code>plTest</code> is convenient if you do not have pre-recorded
request packets that you can supply via the file-descriptor-redirect
method. It is also a convenient way of running a service program in a
debugger such as <code>gdb</code>.

<p>Finally, <code>plTest</code> can be used to generate request
packets as demonstrated in the examples section. These request packets
can be used with the file-descriptor-redirect method.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plTest [-hen]  [-C name=context .. ] [-K ServiceKey]
              [-i filein] [ -o fileout]
              -- [serviceExecutionPath [Arguments]]

Generate a request and run the service using STDIN as the source of
request data. Response Data is written to STDOUT.

Where:
 -C   Set the context for this request - multiple occurences ok
 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
 -e   Print Child Exit details
 -i   Use this file as the request data instead of STDIN
       Useful when running the service under gdb
 -K   Define the serviceKey passed to the service in the
       request (default: plTest.service.0.raw
 -n   Append a Newline to the output
 -o   Use this file to write the response data instead of STDOUT
       Useful when running the service under gdb

 ServiceKey: Place in request (default: plTest.service.0.raw)

ServiceExecutionpath: Location of the service executable. If not
supplied, the request packet is written to STDOUT and -o is ignored.

Arguments: passed to the service executable via execvp()
</pre>

<h4>A note about testing scripting languages</h4>

When using <code>plTest</code> with scripting languages such as perl
and PHP, you need to actually invoke the interpreter as the executable
or make your script into a <i>self-invoking executable</i> by 
adding a <code>#!</code> line to the script and making it executable
with <code>chmod</code>.

<h4>Examples:</h4>

These examples assume you have written a test service called <code>"yourservice"</code> and
it resides in the current directory. A line beginning with a <code>$</code> indicates a shell
prompt where you type in the command (without the dollar naturally).
<p>
1) To run <code>./yourservice</code> and send "Hello World" as the request data go:
<p>
<pre>
$ echo Hello World | plTest ./yourservice
</pre>

<p>
2) To run the <code>system.echo</code> service and set context variables.
<p>
<pre>
$ plTest -Cecho.sleepMS=1000 -Cecho.log=y /usr/local/bin/system.echo.0.raw &lt;testfile
</pre>

<p>
3) To run the <code>./yourservice</code> service program in
<code>gdb</code>. Note the use of the <code>-i</code> and
<code>-o</code> options to ensure that <code>gdb</code> has access to
your tty.

<pre>
$ echo Hello World &gt;testfile
$ plTest -i testfile gdb ./yourservice
</pre>

<p>
4) Use <code>plTest</code> to generate a request packet by <i>not</i>
supplying a <code>serviceExecutionPath</code> parameter, then use that
request packet to run <code>./yourservice</code>.

<pre>
$ echo Hello World | plTest &gt;request.packet
$ ./yourservice 3&lt;request.packet 4&gt;response.packet
</pre>


<p>
5) Testing a php script.

<pre>
$ echo Hello World | plTest php yourservice.php
</pre>

<h3><a name=plTransmitter>plTransmitter: Relay service requests to a
remote host</h3>

<font color=red>Warning: This is an experimental command</font><p>

The <code>plTransmitter</code> program runs as a service and relays
local requests to remote hosts for execution. Typically
<code>plTransmitter</code> will connect to a remote instance of
<code>plReceiver</code>.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plTransmitter [-dhC] [-c connectsPerHost] [-l serviceLifeSecs]
                     [-s maxRequestDurationSecs] hosts...

Transmit Pluton Requests to plReceivers running on remote hosts

Where:
 -C   Connect to all resolved addresses immediately rather than on-demand

 -c   Number of connections per resolved address per host (default: 1)
 -d   Turn on debugging output
 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
 -l   The service should exit after this many seconds to enable a fresh
       set of gethostbyname() results. Zero disables this feature
       (default: 3600)
 -s   Maximum seconds allowed per request (default: 30)

 hosts are a list of hostname[:port] values that are resolved
      with gethostbyname() (default port: 14099)
</pre>


<h3><a name=plReceiver>plReceiver: Accept relayed services from <code>plTransmitter</code></h3>

<font color=red>Warning: This is an experimental command</font><p>

The <code>plReceiver</code> program accepts service requests sent by
<code>plTransmitter</code> and submits them as local requests.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plReceiver [-dh] [-a maxAccepts] [-k ServiceKey]
                  [-l lookupMapPath] [-s maxRequestDurationSecs]
                  [[Interface][:port]]

Accept and submit Pluton Requests sent by remote plTransmitters

Where:

 -a   Maximum number of concurrent accepted requests (default: 10)
 -d   Turn on debugging output
 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)
 -k   Replace requested ServiceKey with this value. This is useful
       when running plReceiver on the same system as plTransmitter.
 -l   The Lookup Map used to connect to the local service (default: '')
 -s   Maximum seconds allowed per request (default: 30)

 Interface and Port define the listening address (default: localhost:14099)
</pre>


<h3><a name=plReloadManager>plReloadManager: Notify plutonManager to
scan for configuration changes</h3>

<p>
The plutonManager is designed to accept configuration changes without
disrupting existing service interactions. When notified by the
<code>plReloadManager</code> command, the plutonManager scans the
configuration direction and adds, deletes or reloads services as
necessary, based on
changes in that directory.

<p>When testing for changes, the plutonManager only checks the
files in the configuration directory, it does not check for changes to any
associated executables or libraries that those executables might load.

<p>The definition of changed is any one of:

<ul>
<li>date-time-modified is newer
<li>File size has changed
<li>Inode has changed

</ul>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: [sudo] plReloadManager [-a]

Where:

 -a   Reload all services regardless of whether their configuration file
      has changed.
</pre>

<p>
The plutonManager makes a concerted effort to shutdown existing
services in the nicest possible way. In short, it lets services exit
of their own accord by sending signals that start with a
gentle <code><b>SIGTERM</b></code> and 
escalate to an unavoidable <code><b>SIGKILL</b></code> if the service
refuses to exit.

<p>
The net result of this gentleness is that you may have to wait some
time before a newly installed service comes into effect. Over ten
seconds in the worst case so please be patient.


<h3><a name=plNetStringGrep>plNetStringGrep: Read netStrings from STDIN and write matching types to STDOUT</h3>

<p>
<code>plNetStringGrep</code> is a diagnostic program that can be used
to selectively filter a netString based on the netString type. This
comes in handy if you want to compare two netstrings - perhaps as part
of a regression test - and you need to filter out variable but
uninteresting data, such as process id or timestamps. This is a truly
geeky tool.

<h4>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plNetStringGrep [-hnv] [typeList]

Read netStrings from STDIN and write matching types to STDOUT.

 -h   Display usage and exit

 -n   Convert the trailing netString terminator to a newline

 -v   Invert the test and only output types that do not match.
       This option is particularly useful for removing variable
       valued netstrings - such as timestamps and process ids - to
       simplify regression test comparisons.

 typeList is a series of netString types to match. If not present
 all types match.

Examples:

 $ plNetStringGrep aFnB: &lt;filein &gt;fileout

      fileout only contains 'a', 'F', 'n', 'B' and ':' types.

 $ plNetStringGrep -v aFnB: &lt;filein &gt;fileoutNot

      fileoutNot contains everything not in fileout.

 $ plNetStringGrep -v a &lt;results &gt;results.stripped
 $ plNetStringGrep -v a &lt;expected | cmp -s - results.stripped
 $ [ $? -ne 0 ] && echo Comparison failed

      Remove the 'a' netString type and compare the rest with
      a previously created regression comparison file to see
      whether results have changed or not.

If the input file does not contain a valid netString
an error message is written to STDERR and the program exits.
