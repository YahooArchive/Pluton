<a name=Introduction>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

If you've seen the sample service program in
the <a href=serviceAPI.html>C++ Service API</a>, you might be
wondering why there is a need for any discussion about how to
structure such a simple program. While the simplicity of a service
program is mostly self-evident, there are subtleties around faults,
when to exit and what exit codes to use, that a well-behaved service
program should adhere to.

<p>The reason for emphasizing the distinction between faults,
<code>exit(0)</code> and exit non-zero, is that these are well defined
ways to communicate with the client and the
<code>pluton_manager</code> and doing this the <i>right way</i>
provides a consistent and predictable experience for clients as well as
assisting in diagnosing services.

<a name=TheModel>
<h3>The model service program</h3>

The sample service program in
<a href=serviceAPI.html>C++ Service API</a> demonstrates all the
attributes of a model service program, as it:

<ul>
<li>Is simple
<li>Relies on a new instances to re-initialize rather than attempting to re-initialize internally
<li>Initializes prior to accepting requests
<li>Uses <code>exit(0)</code> to communicate to
  the <code>pluton_manager</code> that starting a new instance is
  likely to succeed
<li>Uses <code>non-zero exit codes</code> to communicate to
  the <code>pluton_manager</code> that starting a new instance is
  <bold>unlikely</bold> to succeed due to some systemic error
<li>Uses fault returns to indicate application specific errorsto the
 client
</ul>


<a name=exitNonZero>
<h3>When to <code>exit()</code> with a non-zero exit code</h3>

The rule-of-thumb is that a service should exit non-zero if fixing the
cause of the error requires human intervention. For example, if a
configuration file is missing or a hostname does not exist; these are
good reasons to exit non-zero. Conversely, if a network connection to
a server is temporarily lost, that is not a good reason to exit
non-zero.

<p>The reason for this rule is that the <code>pluton_manager</code>
specifically interprets a non-zero exit as an indication that the
service is un-recoverably failing. The service is saying, in effect,
that there is no point in re-starting it. Consequently, the
<code>pluton_manager</code> defers starting new instances regardless
of demand - for a configured amount of time (see the <a
href=configuration.html#exec-failure-backoff>exec-failure-backoff</a>
configuration parameter for details).

<p>
While a service is in this <i>un-recoverable</i> mode, any client
requests are automatically, and immediately, closed.
The implication for clients is that they will get a failed response
without delay when requests are made to an <i>un-recoverable</i>
service.

<p>If your service does exit non-zero, please use exit codes in the
range 1 to 10. The <code>pluton_manager</code> uses exit codes above
10 to communicate why a <code>fork()/exec()</code> sequence failed.

<p>It is also good practice for a service to write a message to STDERR
explaining the reason for the non-zero exit as these messages are
transferred to the log of the <code>pluton_manager</code>.

<a name=exitZero>
<h3>When to <code>exit(0)</code></H3>

The main reason for exiting with a zero exit code is if the service
needs to re-initialize; perhaps due to the loss of a persistent
connection or the loss of some other persistent resource the service
relies on.

<p>While a service <i>can</i> choose to re-initialize in-line it is
most often simpler to just <code>exit(0)</code> and let
the <code>pluton_manager</code> start a fresh instance. More
importantly, unless the service is confident that re-initialization
will occur promptly, the re-initializing service will typically cause
the caller to wait for the duration of the re-initialization in
addition to the duration of processing the request. In general, it is
simpler and faster to allow the client retry mechanism to do the
retrying and connect to another service instance.

<p>Another reason for discouraging re-initialization within a service
is that an exit(0) is visible in the statistics logged by the
<code>pluton_manager</code> whereas re-initialization within the
service will not be visible in a consistent way.


<p>When a service decides to exit while processing a request, the
service
<b>should not send a fault to the client</b>. It should simply exit so
that the client library will automatically retry the attempt.  The
reason for this is that the clientAPI <b>always</b> retries a request
at least once if the request fails without a response, but obviously a
client request will not be retried by the framework if there is a
valid fault response.


<a name=whenToFault>
<h3>When to return a Fault</h3>

Faults are intended to tell the client that their request failed for
business logic reasons entirely relating to their request data.

<p>Faults are not intended to communicate interim problems with
infrastructure or underlying services. Having said that, this is a
guideline more than a hard-and-fast rule; ultimately it's a question
of what interaction works best for a given service.

<p>Generally speaking, if anything goes wrong with a request that does
<i>not</i> warrant exiting based on the earlier guidelines, then a fault
should be returned.

<p>Finally, you should avoid returning fault information in the
response data. The first reason is that the
<code>pluton_manager</code> records the number of faults created by a
service and that statistic is likely to be of use to you! The second
reason is that fault information is purposely independent of the
request serialization whereas response data is likely to be
serialization dependent which complicates error processing for
clients.
