<h3><name=Introduction>Introduction</h3>

As of version 0.50 (circa Aug2008), the C++ client library has been
made reentrant so that it can be used by threaded
applications. Additionally, the C++ client library can actively
participate in concurrent usage if the caller chooses to identify the
thread routines to use..

<p>
No particular threading
system is embedded within the library, rather the application supplies
a series of routines that provide thread identity and mutex functions
needed to ensure reentrancy and protection of critical regions.

<p>
By having
the application supply these routines, any reasonable threading system
can be supported, such as <code>posix threads</code> or
<a href=http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/>State
Threads</a>.

<p>
(Note that State Threads applications are almost certainly
better served by using
the simpler <a href=clientAPINONBlock.html#setPollProxy><code>setPollProxy</code></a>
non-blocking interface to achieve threaded concurrency.)

<p>
In addition to identifying these support routines, the
application <i>must</i> adhere to a small set of rules imposed by the
library so that it can provide simple reentrancy protection.

<h3><a name=Motivation>Motivation for adding threading support</h3>

The primary motivation for adding threading support to the C++ client
library is in preparation for providing client-side support for
Java. Java programs, applications and many of their frameworks often
implicitly rely on underlying thread support. In this context,
providing a high-performance, non-serializing interface to pluton can
only be achieved by integrating well with the Java threaded
environment.

<p>The threading support mechanism described here is designed entirely
  to enable that Java integration. As it happens, this mechanism also
  enables threaded pluton clients efficient and concurrent access to
  pluton services, but that outcome is secondary to supporting Java
  integration.

<h3><a name=Caveats>Caveats regarding threaded programming</h3>

One of the primary goals of the pluton framework is to provide
  parallel services without the need for programmers to write threaded
  programs. The reason for this is that threaded programming of any
  complexity are hard to get right and even harder for a second
  programmer to maintain.

<p>It's also the case that very few application libraries are written
  to be thread-safe or reentrant thus a threaded program typically has
  to re-implement a lot of application-level functionality from
  scratch.

<p>Finally, threaded programming is no panacea for increasing
  performance, so if your motivation for using threads is performance,
  you want to be very sure that you cannot achieve the same outcome via
  simpler means and thus save the poor bunny who inherits your code
  from having a permanent headache.

<p>In all, this means that threads are <i>rarely</i> the right
  solution in our environment so please don't use them unless you are
  a Jedi Master <i>and</i> you are prepared to train those future
  bunnies that will inherit your code.

<h3><a name=Rules>A few simple rules that <i>must</i> be followed</h3>

While it would have been possible to make thread-support completely
transparent to the application, that transparency would have involved
a significant amount of mutex calling (for every accessor at least) as
well as a somewhat complicated internal re-design to maximize
parallelism.

<p>The alternative approach is to impose some simple constraints on the
  application that greatly simplifies the task of the library. This
  implementation has chosen the latter.

<p>
The three simple rules that a threaded pluton client <i>must</i>
follow are:

<ol>
<li><code>pluton::client</code> objects cannot be shared between
  threads. Once a <code>pluton::client</code> object has been created,
  it can only be used by the creating thread.

<li><code>pluton::clientRequest</code> objects cannot be accessed by
  any thread from the time they are added to
  the <code>pluton::client</code> object and until after they have
  been returned to the caller (most often via
  one the <code>executeAndWait*</code> routines).

<li>There is no internal mutex protection when calling any of
  the <code>pluton::clientRequest</code> accessors, so it is the
  responsibility of the application to managed any shared access to
  these objects.
</ol>

<p>The reason for the first restriction relates to the underlying
  implementation that manages a request execution queue per thread.

<p>The reasons for the second restriction are many. In part because
  that <code>pluton::clientRequest</code> accessors are not mutex
  protected - for performance reasons - but also because the client
  API running under any thread actively changes the contents of the
  object as a request progresses. In short, when an application adds a
  request to a <code>pluton::client</code> object it relinquishes any
  right to touch the request until it is returned to the
  application. Note that this constraint has always applied to client
  applications, not just threaded ones.

<p>While <code>pluton::client</code> objects cannot be shared between
  threads, no such restrictions applies
  to <code>pluton::clientRequest</code> objects. When not being
  managed by the <code>pluton::client</code> object, they can be
  freely exchanged between threads - with the presumption that the
  application manages any concurrency issues and abides by rule 2.


<h3><a name=setThreadHandlers>Providing your thread-support routines via <code>pluton::client::setThreadHandlers()</code></h3>

The static <code>pluton::client::setThreadHandlers()</code> method
identifies the routines that the client library
needs to use to ensure thread-safely. The semantics of these
routines are modeled after <code>pthread(3)</code> with the
expectation that this is the most likely threading system used.

<p>The <code>pluton::client::setThreadHandlers()</code>
method <i>must</i> be called prior to any construction
of <code>pluton::client</code> objects; otherwise
an <code>assert(3)</code> will result if this order is not honored.
Additionally, the <code>pluton::client::setThreadHandlers()</code>
method can only be called once per process otherwise, you guessed it,
an <code>assert(3)</code> will result.

<p>
<center>
<i>
(The rationale for using <code>assert(3)</code> is simply based on the
  fact that proceeding in the presence of such errors is likely to be
  catastrophic for the application.)
</i>
</center>

<p>From the synopsis, it is clear that most of the supplied methods
  to <code>pluton::client::setThreadHandlers()</code> are optional,
  though not providing them can only possibly make sense in a
  non-preemptive threading environment.

<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

<pre>
  #include &lt;pluton/client.h&gt;

  void setThreadHandlers(pluton::thread_self_t,
			 pluton::mutex_new_t mNew=0,
                         pluton::mutex_delete_t mDelete=0,
                         pluton::mutex_lock_t mLock=0,
                         pluton::mutex_unlock_t mUnlock=0);  
</pre>

<h5>TYPEDEFS</h5>

The following typedefs are defined in the <code>pluton</code>
namespace in <code>&lt;pluton/client.h&gt;</code>. Your support
routines are at liberty to define the <code>pluton::mutex</code>
and <code>pluton::thread</code> structures as they see fit.

<pre>
  typedef struct thread* thread_t;
  typedef struct mutex* mutex_t;
  
  typedef pluton::thread_t (*thread_self_t)(const char* who);
  typedef pluton::mutex_t (*mutex_new_t)(const char* who);
  typedef void (*mutex_delete_t)(const char* who, pluton::mutex_t);
  typedef int (*mutex_lock_t)(const char* who, pluton::mutex_t);
  typedef int (*mutex_unlock_t)(const char* who, pluton::mutex_t);
</pre>

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

<h3><a name=pthreadExample>Example using posix threads</h3>

This example shows one way in which an application might
identify <code>pthread</code> routines as those providing the
underlying support. This example defines
the <code>pluton::mutex</code> structure which minimizes the need
for <code>reinterpret_cast<>()</code>.


<p>Note that the application supplied methods are nothing more than
  super-thin wrappers for the <code>pthread</code> routines.
<pre>

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

class pluton::mutex {
public:
  mutex() { pthread_mutex_init(&pm, 0); }
  ~mutex() { pthread_mutex_destroy(&pm); }
  pthread_mutex_t pm;
};

static pluton::mutex_t mNew(const char* who) { return new pluton::mutex; }
static void mDelete(const char* who, pluton::mutex_t m) { delete m; }

static int mLock(const char* who, pluton::mutex_t m) { return pthread_mutex_lock(&m->pm); }
static int mUnlock(const char* who, pluton::mutex_t m) { return pthread_mutex_unlock(&m->pm); }

static pluton::thread_t tSelf(const char* who) { return reinterpret_cast&lt;pluton::thread_t&gt;(pthread_self()); }

int
main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  pluton::client::setThreadHandlers(tSelf, mNew, mDelete, mLock, mUnlock);

  ..
</pre>


<h3><a name=howUsed>How the supplied Thread Handlers are used internally</h3>

In part due to the <a href=#Rules>prohibition</a> against sharing
<code>pluton::client</code> objects between threads, the client
library requires very limited use of the supplied handlers.

<p>Actually usage is:
<ul>
<li>One call to <code>mutex_new_t</code> during the call
to <code>pluton::client::setThreadHandlers</code>.

<li>A single <code>mutex_lock_t</code> and <code>mutex_unlock_t</code>
sequence during construction of each <code>pluton::client</code>. This
  is to allocate a per-thread request queue structure.

<li>Numerous calls to <code>thread_self_t</code>, especially on entry
  into any of the <code>executeAndWait*()</code> set. As a defensive
  measure, they all check for adherence to the <a href=#Rules>rule</a>
  about not sharing <code>pluton::client</code> objects between
  threads.
</ul>

What this demonstrates is that the internal use of thread-protecting
machinery is absolutely minimalist and consequentially efficient. This
is an outcome of our <a href=#Rules>few simple rules</a> and is
hopefully an acceptable trade-off for applications.
