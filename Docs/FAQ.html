<h3>Configurations</h3>


<h3>General/Philosophical</h3>

<a name=G1>
<h4>G1: Can a service be too small?</h4>

Yes. The benefit to making a function into a separate service revolves
around latency, frequency-of-use and resource usage. If a function has
low latency, is invoked very frequently and consumes few resources, it
is not a great candidate for making into a service.

<p>As a rule of thumb, if a function consumes less than 10
milliseconds of latency or CPU, then it is not likely to be
significant enough to make into a service.

<p>There are many exceptions though, for example if you need process
isolation due to segfault-inducing bugs or resource leaks, then you
might make a function into a separate service, even though there are
no latency benefits.

<a name=G2>
<h4>G2: What serialization-type is best?</h4>

There is no right answer to this question, apart from "it depends". In
general, you should use a serialization type that works well with the
programming environment you are using. There is rarely much point in
using a non-native serialization type if that imposes heavy conversion
costs at each end of the service.

<p>Service output that is ultimately destined for Javascript programs
can often benefit from the JSON format as Javascript programs can
instantiate objects directly from JSON. Conversely, PHP serialization
might be right for a heavy PHP environment. It all depends.

<p>Obvious exceptions include company-wide standardization requirements and the
convenience of consistency of a common serialization.

<a name=G3>
<h4>G3: Are there any issues with exchanging large
amounts of data between clients and services?</h4>

The main two issues to consider are that the data has to travel
through a local socket so there is a transfer cost and the request and
response has to fit in memory for the client and service.

<p>Apart from that, there are no limitations intrinsic to the system.

<a name=G99>
<h4>G99: <i>It</i> doesn't work - what should I do?</h4>

For some value of <i>"it"</i>, the most important thing to do is
understand what isn't working exactly. Even if you can't fix your
problem, having concise information makes it much easier for others
to help you.

<p>
The typically diagnostic process includes the following:
<ol>
<li>Check that 
<a href=commands.html#plPing><code>plPing</code></a>
runs

<li>Make sure daemontools and the plutonManager are running (<a
href=#M7>M7</a> and <a href=#M8>M8</a>)

<li>Check that the Manager is making periodic entries to the
log (<a href=#M6>M6</a>)

<li>Ensure that all the permissions and ownership values of all
entries in 
<code>/usr/local/var/pluton</code> match those of a working instance
on another machine. They should look like this:

<pre>
$ ls -lRa /usr/local/var/pluton

/usr/local/var/pluton:
total 16
drwxr-xr-x   3 puser wheel 4096 Jun 13 10:04 .
drwxr-xr-x  13 root  root  4096 May 19 13:41 ..
-r--r--r--   1 puser users  278 Jun 13 10:04 lookup.map
drwxr-xr-x   2 puser wheel 4096 Jun 13 10:04 rendezvous

/usr/local/var/pluton/rendezvous:
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  2 puser wheel 4096 Jun 13 10:04 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 puser wheel 4096 Jun 13 10:04 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 puser users 4365 Jun 13 10:04 system.curl.0.raw.mmap
srw-rw-rw-  1 puser users    0 Jun 13 10:04 system.curl.0.raw.socket
-rw-r--r--  1 puser users 4365 Jun 13 10:04 system.echo.0.raw.mmap
srw-rw-rw-  1 puser users    0 Jun 13 10:04 system.echo.0.raw.socket
</pre>

<li>Make sure your service executable runs in the relatively pristine
environment created by the plutonManager. 
<a href=commands.html#plTest><code>plTest</code></a>
is a good tool to test out your service.

</ol>
<p>

If, after all those steps, you are still no closer to understanding
the problem, you should collect the information you gathered during
this and ask the folk on the github.com list.



<h3>Client API</h3>

<a name=C1><h4>C1: Can you put response times into the requests so I
can see how long a service takes?</h4>

Tracking the response time of a request could be added to the client
API, but you should know that the manager produces periodic reports on
the response times of services. Average response time, slowest 10
responses, CPU used per request, memory size, etc. The idea is that
you can slurp these standardized reports into a database/spreadsheet
and analyze the performance of every service over time.

<p>
Also, this sort of functionality can be  easily achieved by the caller
tracking response times thus:

<p>
<pre>
    addRequest(R1);
    addRequest(Rn);

    struct timeval startTime;
    gettimeofday(startTime, 0);
    while (pluton::clientRequest R = client::executeAndWaitAny()) {
        struct timeval now;
        gettimeofday(now, 0);
        calculate_response_time(R, start, now);
    }

</pre>

If you simply want to know how long service takes on an ad
hoc basis, you might want to try the <code>-e</code> option for the <a
href=commands.html#plSend><code>plSend</code></a> command.

<a name=C2><h4>C2: Is the client library thread-safe?</h4>
<p>
As of version 0.50 and later, the C++ client library is reentrant and
can be used by threads if the application follows a number of rules as
described in the <a href=threading.html>thread interface</a> document.

<p>As a precaution, the client library tracks re-entrant call attempts that do
not follow the rules via a <i>oneAtATime</i>-type flag and will generate
an<code>assert()</code> failure if it detects re-entrant call attempts or other
catastrophic call sequences. The <code>assert()</code> message looks something
like one of these:

<pre>
perCallerClient.cc:66: failed assertion `_oneAtATimePerCaller == false'

clientImpl.cc:75: failed assertion `_oneAtATimePerThread == false'
</pre>

<a name=C3><h4>C3: Is it possible to <i>fire and forget</i> with Pluton?</h4>

By "fire and forget" if you mean to initiate a service and then not
have to wait for the result, then sure, set the
<a href=clientAPI.html#noWaitAttr><code>noWaitAttr</code></a>
attribute on the request.

<p>There are two caveats with using the 
<a href=clientAPI.html#noWaitAttr><code>noWaitAttr</code></a>
attribute:

<ul>
<li>The <i>no wait</i> means no waiting for the <i>response</i> from the
service. The client still waits until the request is sent to
the socket buffer connected to the service instance. This means that
the client still waits until there is a free service instance.

<li>The only guarantee is
that all of the request is sent to the service, whether the service
even reads the complete request or whether it is
able to complete the request is, naturally, unknown, unless the client
and service communicate thru a side-channel of some sort.
</ul>

<h3>Service API</h3>

<a name=S1>
<h4>S1: How do I test a service independently of the manager?</h4>

<p>Testing a service independently of the manager is easy and
encouraged. There are a number of ways you can do this and it's an
easy way to build regression tests and to verify your service in the
early stages of development.

If you are new to Pluton then you mind want to read
<a href=howToTestService.html>How to Test Your Service</a>
which goes into much greater detail than this FAQ entry.

<p>
If you just need a refresher, then recall that the
<a href=commands.html#plTest><code>plTest</code></a>
program runs services independently of the manager and generates
requests from STDIN.

<p>
Second, if you have recorded requests for this service, then the
service can be run from the command line by setting up fd3 as the
input request packet and arranging the output of fd4 to be the
response packet. This technique is commonly referred to as the
<i>file-descriptor-redirect</i> technique.
<p>
<pre>
$ /path/service 3&lt;requestFile 4&gt;responseFile
</pre>
This technique is particularly useful if you need to run the service
under a debugger such as <code>gdb</code>.

<p>
If you want to feed a service a request packet from STDIN and have
the response packet written to STDOUT, you can use this style
of redirection:
<p>
<pre>
$ /path/service 3&lt;&amp;0 4&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<a name=S2><h4>S2: Should services be stateless?</h4>

Services are normally stateless - think of them as a super
light-weight web-services. Having said that, a recent enhancement
request resulted in the <code>affinity</code> attributes which allows
a client to persist a connection once established so they can get back
to the same service instance on each subsequent request.

<p>It's not clear that <code>affinity</code> is entirely consistent
with the spirit of the original idea, but the customer is always
right!

<a name=S3><h4>S3:How do multiple clients avoid contention when
accessing a service?</h4>

Within the constraints of the <a href=configuration.html>service
configuration</a>, the <a
href=plutonManager.html><code>plutonManager</code></a> manages the
number of service instances dynamically. Client's block on an
connect() to a Unix Socket until an instance becomes free. Well, they
block until the timeout expires.

<p>The service API automatically reports concurrency and response
times to the manager so the manager knows how busy the aggregate pool
of service instances are. In fact, that's the primary purpose of the
manager; to manage the pool of services and track resource usage.

<p>Each service is managed as a separate pool - there is no
relationship between separately configured services.

<a name=S4><h4>S4: Does a service have to be a stand-alone
executable?</h4>

Yes. The per-process encapsulation is one of the key design principles
of Pluton as it enables:

<ul>
<li>Automatic resource monitoring by the plutonManager
<li>Fault isolation
<li>Ease of debugging with gdb or similar
<li>Memory corruption isolation, etc
</ul>

<p>The manager is largely passive as all it does is a fork/exec
sequence to create service instances and arrange a few file
descriptors for the service API.

<a name=S5><h4>S5: How do I run a scripting language service written in perl or PHP?</h4>

(Note: this is actually a general discussion that applies running any
scripting language program in a Unix environment).

<p>Scripting languages
need to invoke their interpreter to be run and this can be done in one of
two ways. Either the script is supplied as a command line argument to
the interpreter, eg:

<p>
<code>
$ php myprogram.php
</code>
<p>

or the script is converted into a <i>self-invoking executable</i> with the
following steps:

<ol>
<li>Add the path to the interpreter as the first <code>#!</code> line of the
script, eg:
<p>
<code>
#! /usr/local/bin/php
<br>
&lt;?php
<br>
..
</code>
<li>Change the file mode of the script file to be executable

<p>
<code>
$ chmod +x myprogram.php
</code>
</ol>

<p>
(The <code>#!</code> magic is standard across all Unixen).
<p>
Once that is done, you run your script program as a regular executable
from the shell prompt, eg:

<p>
<code>
$ ./myprogram.php
</code>

<p>
<h5>Scripting languages in service configuration</h5>

This discussion applies for service executables when
run via a service configuration.  Recall that the
 <a href=configuration.html#exec><code>exec</code></a>
 line in the service
configuration must point to an executable; this means that you can
either run the interpreter directly, eg:
<p>
<code>
exec /usr/local/bin/php path-to-your-script
</code>
</p>

or turn your script into a <i>self-invoking executable</i> as described above
and supply it directly in the
 <a href=configuration.html#exec><code>exec</code></a>
 line, eg:

<p>
<code>
exec path-to-your-script
</code>

<h5>Scrpting languages and the
<a href=commands.html#plTest><code>plTest</code></a> command</h5>

This discussion also applies to testing scripting languages services
with plTest; either invoke the scripting command directly, eg:

<p>
<code>
$ plTest php myprogram.php
</code>
<p>
or turn the script into a <i>self-invoking executable</i> and run it
directly, eg:

<p>
<code>
$ plTest ./myprogram.php
</code>
<p>


<h3>Manager</h3>

<a name=M1>
<h4>M1: What user does a service normally run as?</h4>

The service processes inherit the user credentials from the
plutonManager. With a normal installation that will be the user
'puser.

<a name=M2>
<h4>M2: What happened to M2?</h4>

It got morphed and moved to <a href=#S6>S6</a>.

<a name=M3>
<h4>M3: When should I need to kill the manager?</h4>

Generally, the answer is never. Recall that the manager plays a
passive role in the client-to-service interaction so it is the
services that are more likely to require restarting.

<p>The normal action is to signal the manager to reload the
configuration with the <code><a
href=commands.html#plReloadManager>plReloadManager</a></code>
command. In this case it will scan the configuration directory for any
changes and replace changed services.

<a name=M4>
<h4>M4: How do I stop/start/restart the manager?</h4>

The plutonManager is run as a <i>supervised</i> process so the usual
<code>svc</code> invocations are available.

<a name=M5>
<h4>M5: Why does the manager take so long to shut down?</h4>

After being signaled to shut down or restart, the manager tries to
shut down all active services in an orderly manner. To achieve this,
the manger issues a series of increasing aggressive signals to each
service process until they exit or until the manager runs out of
escalation options (the last being kill -9).

<p>This orderly shutdown can take some time to complete as the manager
assumes that a service may be currently processing a request and
prefers to give it time to complete - within reason. In short please
be patient with the slow nature of the shutdown.

<p>Watching the manager log is instructive in terms of shut down
progress. The next FAQ entry discusses logging.

<a name=M6>
<h4>M6: How do I find out what the manager is doing?</h4>

The manager writes a relatively extensive log to
<code>/usr/local/logs/pluton_manager/current</code>. This log file can me
monitored with the following command:

<pre>
tail -F /usr/local/logs/pluton_manager/current | /usr/local/bin/tai64nlocal
</pre>

Many of these log entries are documented on <a href=logs.html>this</a>
page. In addition, the types of log entries being generated can be
changed dynamically via the <a
href=plutonManager.html#CommandPort>Command Port</a>.

<a name=M7>
<h4>M7: The manager appears not to have started - why not?</h4>

There are numerous reasons why the manager may not have started,
ranging from installation issues to people <i>helpfully</i> modifying
files and permissions in <code>/usr/local/var/pluton</code> - of course you
should never do this
unless you are absolutely sure of the implications.

<a name=M8>
<h4>M8: How do I manually run the <code>plutonManager</code>?</h4>

If the manager appears not to be running or you suspect a problem with
<code>daemontools</code>, you may want to run the
manager manually to help diagnose the problem.

<p>
To run the manager manually, first make sure that the manager truly is
not running via <code>ps</code> or similar. Then, as root, run this
command:

<pre>
sh -x /usr/local/var/daemontools/plutonManager/run
</pre>
<p>
at which point you should see the output of the manager on your screen.

<a name=M9>
<h4>M9: Why does the manager take so long to start?</h4>

Or put another way: if a service is called immediately after the
manager is started, the client can sometimes get a timeout, why is
this?

<p>
There is usually a delay of a couple of seconds after the manager has
been told to start before services are available. There are two main
reasons for this.

<p>
First, the manager is itself typically managed by
<a href=http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html>daemontools</a>
which only scans for new services every 5 seconds. Thus it could
take up to 5 seconds after yinst start before daemontools notices the
manager entry and starts it up.

<p>
Second, the startup script of the manager first runs
the <code>plKillOldServices</code> command which cleans up the shared
directories and any residual services that might be running. This
latter process involves a kill/sleep/check loop which could take
another 5 seconds or so to complete, though a normal restart after a
normal shutdown will should not incur any delay here.

<p>
Due to <code>daemontools</code> the manager is normally started
once when the system is booted and remains running until it
reboots. In other words, manager restarts are rare events.

<p>As a final note, installing new services (or new versions of a
service) should not normally require restarting the manager. Rather,
the right strategy is two either:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Replace the service executable/file
<li>Update the service config file (a touch does the trick)
<li>run
  the <a href=commands.html#plReloadManager><code>plReloadManager</code></a>
  command which causes the manager to scan the configuration directory
  for changes
</ol>
<p>
or, in a development environment you can be lazier and go:

<ol>
<li>Replace the service executable
<li>killall old instances of the service
</ol>

<p>
which means that all future instances of that service can only
possibly be the newly installed executable.
