<h3>Introduction</h3>
</a>

<a name=Overview>
<h4>Overview of pluton</h4>
Pluton is a framework which can help make network applications -
especially web server applications - faster, lighter-weight, easier to
debug, <em>and</em> potentially less resource intensive. The core
features of the framework include:

<ul>
<li>encapsulation of functional services into self-contained, independent
executables

<li>a convenient, fast and simple interface to
these functional services

<li>an interface which actively encourages and simplifies parallel
service requests to reduce aggregate latency

<li>a serialization-agnostic interface between clients and services -
you get to choose your serialization poison

</ul>

<p>
The primary goal of the Pluton Framework is to replace large, brittle,
high latency, network applications embedded in web servers with
smaller, flexible applications which use co-operative, independent
services in parallel to create a low-latency experience.

<h4>A simple example</h4>

Imagine you have a web application that makes calls to "getAd",
"lookupUser" and "getBuddies". All of these functions are currently
implemented as libraries which:

<ul>
<li>are called serially
<li>make a network call to a remote service that can be very slow
<li>may unfortunately leak memory
<li>may unfortunately sometimes core dump
</ul>

<p>
With pluton, you can isolate your application from all of these issues
<i>and</i> run them all in parallel to greatly reduce latency.

<h3>Is pluton right for you?</h3>

A series of tests to help you decide whether pluton is right for
you.

<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Situation<th>How pluton can help</tr>

<tr><td>Your web application makes a number of network requests to remote services
<td>pluton can execute all of these requests in parallel and
dramatically reduce your aggregate latency</tr>

<tr><td>Tuning your web application is complex due to the unknown performance
of all the dependencies
<td>pluton isolates components and reports on their system resource usage</tr>

<tr><td>Your web application core dumps in mysterious ways (and you
suspect a 3rd-party library you have no control over)
<td>Use pluton to isolate components so that buggy libraries do not impact
the core application</tr>

<tr><td>Your web application makes calls to libraries that can block
for too long (or that have timeouts you can't control)
<td>Move the library into a service then you control how long you wait
for the service</tr>

<tr><td>Your web application is using a library that leaks memory
<td>Place the library in a separate service and your problem goes away</tr>

<tr><td>Your PHP application wants access to a library that is only
available in C++
<td>Write a small C++ service that calls that library then change
your PHP application to call the service</tr>

<tr><td>Your Java application wants access to a library that is only
available in PHP
<td>Write a small PHP service that calls that library then change your
Java application to call the service</tr>

<tr><td>Your C++ application wants access to a library that is only
available in Java
<td>Write a small Java service that calls that library then change your
C++ application to call the service</tr>

<tr><td>You have computationally intensive operations that you would
like to run in parallel
<td>Move the computation into a separate service and invoke multiple instances in
parallel to take full advantage of all the CPUs and cores on the
system</tr>

<tr><td>You want to prototype new functionality in a
<i>fast-to-write</i> language like PHP, but be able to easily change
to a <i>fast-to-execute</i> language like C++
<td>Create the functionality as a service then write it in any
language you wish without ever having to worry about language
dependencies</tr>

<tr><td>You have rapidly changing functionality and continually
reloading your web server has a negative user impact
<td>Place the functionality in a service as replacing services is
completely transparent and non-disruptive
</tr>

<tr><td>Your web application has a very heavy memory footprint due to
the large number of libraries you use
<td>Move the libraries into separate services and dramatically reduce
the footprint of your web server instances. If done comprehensively,
your web application may be so light-weight as to allow <i>keep-alives</i>
</tr>

<a name=DocElevatorPitch>
<h4>Elevator Pitch</h4>

<p>
The key concept is that you move the major functions of your web
application out into a separate set of executable programs. These
separate executable programs are called
<i>services</i> in pluton parlance and are managed for you by
the <a href=plutonManager.html>plutonManager</a>.

<p>
By way of example, if your web application currently calls subroutine
<code>AgetAd</code> then subroutine <code>BlookupUser</code> and
finally subroutine <code>CfindBuddies</code>, you can turn those
subroutines into separate <i>services</i> and use pluton to exchange
requests with those services. The <i>value-add</i> is that pluton
makes this very easy to do.

<p>And why would you want to move subroutines out of your application
into separate services? The reasons are many.

<p>For a start, pluton makes it trivially easy to call those three
services in parallel - even in languages that do not support parallel
processing such as PHP. If <code>AgetAd</code>,
<code>BlookupUser</code> or <code>CfindBuddies</code> happen to
involve high latency network requests, pluton automatically overlaps
this latency and improved the response time of your web server -
possible dramatically. Performance!

<p>A second reason for moving a subroutine or function out into a
pluton service is that it insulates your application from that
function. If subroutine <code>AgetAd</code> happens to be a bit buggy
or subroutine <code>BlookupUser</code> has memory leaks or subroutine
<code>CfindBuddies</code> tends to dump core, moving it to a pluton
service completely insulates your main application from those
problems. Resilience!

<p>A third reason for moving large subroutines into a pluton service
is that it can significantly reduce the memory footprint of your web
service and make it possible to run many more instances of your web
service on a given system. Efficiency!

<p>There are numerous other benefits too, but since we've reached your
floor, we'll finish with this summary:

By using pluton you can end up with smaller faster web applications
that are much more stable and use <i>less</i> resources. True!

<h3>Documentation</h3>
</a>


<a name=DocBackground>
<h4>Background Reading</h4>

For general reading start with the <a href=overview.html>overview</a>
document. For a detailed understanding, you might want to read the <a
href=background.html>background and motivation</a> as well as the <a
href=design.html>design</a> document.

<p>

<a name=DocMainComponents>
<h4>Main Components</h4>

The main components of the Pluton Framework include:

<ul>
<li>the <a href=plutonManager.html>plutonManager</a>, the daemon which
manages the self-contain services and the rendezvous sockets

<li>the <a href=configuration.html>configuration</a> file format used to
describe each service

<li>the <a href=serialization.html>serialization types</a> which are
currently defined

<li>a description of <a href=serviceKey.html>Service Keys</a> which are a pervasive part of
the Pluton Framework used to discover services, identify
configuration files and name temporary file system objects

<li>and <a href=commands.html>command line utilities</a> to access and query
the plutonManager and services
</ul>

<a name=DocForProgrammers>
<h3>For Programmers</h3>

Currently pluton has language bindings for C++, C, PHP, Java and perl.

<p>
There is a special C++ API that supports programs written with
<a href=http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/>State Threads</a>
or
<a href=http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>libevent</a>. This 
<a href=clientAPINonBlock.html>C++ Non-blocking API</a> is specifically
designed to integrate with these systems.

<h4>Writing Service Programs</h4>

There are separate pages explaining how to
<a href=howToStructureService.html>structure</a> and
how to
<a href=howToTestService.html>test</a> your service.

<p>
If you are looking for an existing service to use, this <a href=catalog.html>catalog</a>
of services might be of use.

<h4>Other useful information</h4>

There are pages that:

<ul>
<li>explain the <a href=logs.html>log entries</a> generated by the
plutonManager

<li>give indicative <a href=performance.html>performance</a> numbers which
show likely throughput and latency costs

<li>discuss plans and suggestions for <a
href=future.html>future</a> versions

<li>and finally finally, a <a href=FAQ.html>FAQ</a> to catch miscellaneous questions.
</ul>
