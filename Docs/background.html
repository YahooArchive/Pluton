<a name=Introduction>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
</a>

Pluton is a framework which can help make web applications
light-weight, easy to debug, faster <em>and</em> potentially less
resource intensive.

<p>
A number of conspiring factors have resulted in many web applications
becoming large, unwieldy, brittle and slow. These factors include the
network effect problem, the latency problem and the weakest link
problem.

The primary goal of the Pluton Framework is to make it possible to
replace these large, brittle web applications with smaller, flexible
applications which use co-operative, independent services.


<h4><a name=networkEffectProblem>The Network Effect Problem</h4>

A key feature of modern web applications is that they combine data
from numerous sources to render a rich experience. One meaning of
<em>network effect</em> is to take advantage of a related set of
content sources to provide a more comprehensive experience.

Consider a calendar application which might consult multiple calendars
to present an aggregate view; or an address book application which
might want to include online presence indication; or a portal-type
page which might render calendar status, online presence, ads, local
weather and news headlines.

<p>
From a user perspective, combining different data sources provides a
richer experience, but it comes at a significant increase in
application complexity which implies more code, a bigger footprint and
many more library dependencies.

<p>
By dividing the application into smaller, self-contained services, the
complexity is substantially reduced as each service can be tested,
debugged and tuned independently of each other and the main application.


<h4><a name=latencyProblem>The Latency Problem</a></h4>

Feature rich web applications often collect data from a variety of
external data sources. Typically, access to these data sources
involves a series of comparatively high-latency network requests which
in aggregate can add up to a lot of user-visible delay. Consider just
five remote data sources at 30ms each? This adds up to a distinctly
visible 150ms of delay.

<p>
The Pluton Framework provides an easy and safe way to issue multiple
requests in parallel such that the aggregate latency is reduced to the
duration of the slowest request, not the sum of all requests. Within
the Pluton Framework, those five remote requests could potentially all
complete within an aggregate latency of just 30ms.


<h4><a name=weakestLinkProblem>The Weakest Link Problem</a></h4>

A large monolithic web application typically includes many independent
libraries. If any one of those libraries has a memory corruption bug,
a resource leak or a performance problem, it affects the whole
application. Sometimes catastrophically such as randomly dumping core
or getting stuck in some CPU loop.

<p>
If an application includes, say, ten libraries (a very small number by
current standards), then you only need one bug in one of those ten
libraries to cause the application to fail. Essentially, each
additional library increases the probability of an application failure
through no fault of the application program. To make matters worse,
even if the current set of libraries happen to be bug-free, some
future version may not be as well behaved, causing a previously stable
and unchanged application to mysteriously start failing.

<p>
By encapsulating separate functions in self-contained execution
units, bugs are contained within the encapsulated executable which protects
the main application and makes it much easier to isolate the location
of the fault.


<h4><a name=additionalProblems>Additional Problems</a></h4>

Above and beyond the main problems identified above, there are
numerous, well-known disadvantages to monolithic web applications. These
include:

<ul>
<li>Difficult performance analysis - time consuming instrumentation is
often required to find a slow piece of functionality
<li>Unwieldy core dumps - large executables create large core files
<li>Difficult to debug - the inclusion of debugging symbols is outside of
your control
<li>Difficult to regression test - each API requires a separate and
different regression test program
<li>Difficult to isolate unexpected changes in behavior
<li>Library version conflicts increases exponentially with the number
of libraries
</ul>

Many of these difficulties are substantially reduced in the Pluton Framework.

<a name=Architecture>
<h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
</a>

The Pluton Framework consists of:

<ol>
<li>a <a href=configuration.html>configured</a> set of self-contained,
stand-alone service executables which accept requests and send
responses

<li>the <a href=plutonManager.html>plutonManager</a> - a long-running
daemon which manages service instances and their rendezvous sockets

<li>a simple <a href=clientAPI.html>client API</a> to
issue service requests in parallel

<li>a simple <a href=serviceAPI.html>service API</a> to connect
service programs to their corresponding rendezvous socket

<li>a file-system based naming convention for service discovery
</ol>

<p>
The following diagram shows the relationship between the major
components and an application.
<p>

<p><font size=-1>(Click on image for a larger version).</font>
</center>
<p>
Admittedly, this diagram suggests a complex set of interactions,
however these are largely required for management functions, the
interaction between the client and services is very simple with all
management functions completely contained within the APIs.


<h4><a name=plutonManager>The plutonManager</a></h4>

The plutonManager is a long-running daemon which is responsible for
managing all of the components except the client applications. For each
configured service, the plutonManager:

<ul>
<li>creates the service Rendezvous Socket
<li>adds a "Service Key to Rendezvous Socket" entry in the shared
memory Lookup Table
<li>creates the service Reporting Socket
<li>forks and execs the service instances
<li>monitors and logs performances statistics automatically generated
by each service instance
</ul>

The plutonManager dynamically adjusts the number of service instances
based on configuration limits, application demand and a number of
performance factors. The competing goals are to provide sufficient service
instances to maximize request concurrency while minimizing excess
capacity and system impact.

<p>One of the most important roles of the plutonManager is to generate
a consistent set of performance log entries which can be used to analyze
service performance over time. The log entries include:

<ul>
<li>Average elapse-time per request
<li>Total Memory size on exit
<li>Total CPU used on exit
<li>Total number of successful requests
<li>Total number of fault requests
<li>A short list of the slowest elapse times
</ul>

This information is purposely amenable to parsing and storage in a
database which can then be used to trend the performance of a service
over time and over new releases.


<h4><a name=Services>Services</a></h4>

Services are stand-alone executable programs written for the
framework. Services use the <a href=serviceAPI.html>service API</a> to
accept requests and send responses. A service program is largely
oblivious to the fact that it is running within this framework.

<p>
All services are implemented as a loop. Here is a skeletal "Hello
World" service which demonstrates this loop:
<p>

<center>
<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
 #include &lt;pluton/service.h&gt;

 int
 main(int argc, char** argv)
 {
     pluton::service	     S;
     pluton::serviceRequest  R;

     S.initialize();

     while (S.getRequest(R)) {
         S.sendResponse("Hello Worlds, all eight of you!");
     }

     S.terminate();

     return(0);
 }
</pre>
</table>
</center>

<p>
If you want to be lazy about checking for errors, this is literally
all the code you need to create a service. Oh, and obviously you'll
need some code which actually does something useful, but that's your
problem...

<p>
Some basic attributes of service programs:

<ul>

<li>Connections to databases or remote services should be established
just once and prior to calling
<code>pluton::service::initialize()</code>. Henceforth, if any error
occurs, a service program should simply exit. The manager is
responsible for re-starting a new instance.

<p><li>Services are expected to perpetually iterate on the
<code>getRequest()</code> method to amortize their creation and initialized costs
across many requests. Normally the decision to exit is made by the
plutonManager and service API. This decision is indicated to the
service via a false return from <code>getRequest()</code>.


<p><li>Services should not overly concern themselves with managing
timeouts to meet client response-time requirements. The client API
manages this aspect of the exchange.

<p><li>Services should be written as single-threaded, serial request
processors. All parallelism is achieved by multiple instances of a
service.

</ul>

Generally speaking, service programs should be simple and perform just
one function or a set of common functions.


<h4><a name=Clients>Clients</a></h4>

Clients use the <a href=clientAPI.html>client API</a> to exchange
requests with services. A key feature of the client API is that
multiple service requests can be issued concurrently which greatly
reduces aggregate latency. In fact multiple requests to the same
service can similarly be issued in parallel - then all such requests
are processed in parallel within the constraint of available services
and system resources.

<p>
Unlike services, the Pluton Framework does not imply an implementation
model for clients. This is <em>the</em> area where the programmer need
to be creative; they should think about which functions can be
encapsulated as a service and they should think about which services
can be requested in parallel by the application.

Generally speaking,
a well designed client is one which maximizes the benefits of the
Pluton Framework.

<p>
For those interest, <a href=sampleClient.html>here</a> is a sample
client program intended to give an idea of how the client API can be
used - it does not represent the archetypal client. The most salient
point to note is that the sample client makes two service requests in
parallel it then waits for all requests to complete. Other
<code>pluton::client</code> methods allow waiting for one, any or no
requests to complete prior to returning to the caller.


<h4><a name=Rendezvous>Rendezvous Sockets</a></h4>

Each service exchanges requests via a unique Unix Domain socket -
called a Rendezvous Socket in pluton parlance.

<p>
The client API discovers the path to the Rendezvous Socket via the
Lookup Table and connects to that socket to exchange the request. The
plutonManager is responsible for managing the existence of Rendezvous
Sockets but is not involved in the actual exchange of data.

<p>
Rendezvous Sockets are transparent to clients and
services - at least for the reason that  they conceivably may be replaced with a more efficient
message-passing system - should one somehow spring into existence.


<h4><a name=Lookup>Service Naming and Lookup Table</a></h4>

Clients gain access to a service by their Service Key. The Lookup
Table is a shared-memory structure which maps Service Keys to
the path of Rendezvous Sockets. At the time of writing, the exact syntax of
Service Keys is still under discussion, but the current thinking is
along the lines of a dot separated set of tokens as follows:

<pre>
	<a href=serviceKey.html>Application.Function.Version.Serialization</a>
</pre>

where <code>Function</code> can be empty to indicate a wild-card. The
Lookup Table provides an efficient means of resolving wild-card
lookups. Example Service Keys are:

<pre>
	Mail.GetFolderList.1.XML
or
	AddressBook.AddEntry.0.JSON
</pre>

If a service is configured as a wild-card, it is only used
if a more specific Service Key does not exist. For example, if two
services are configured as:

<pre>
	AddressBook..0.JSON
and

	AddressBook.AddEntry.0.JSON
</pre>

a client request to <code>AddressBook.AddEntry.0.JSON</code>
resolves to the second service and <code>AddressBook.GetList.0.JSON</code>
resolves to the first service.

<p>
If a service is configured with a wild-card entry, the service is
responsible for <code>Function</code> verification and de-multiplexing.

<p>

(<em>Note to Reviewers:</em>
<i>If wild-card lookups are deemed to be of no
utility, the Lookup Table can be eliminated to reduce complexity and
gain a tiny performance saving for clients).
</i>


<h4><a name=Reporting>Reporting Sockets</a></h4>

Each service is provided with a Unix socket which is used by the
service API to write performance data back to the plutonManager. The
plutonManager uses this data to log aggregate statistics and to
optimize the number of service instances.

<p>
As with Rendezvous Sockets, Reporting Sockets are similarly
transparent to the service and managed by the client API
and plutonManager.

<a name=Together>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
</a>

The Pluton Framework is conceptually straightforward. Services exist
as stand-alone executables which listen for connections on their
Rendezvous Socket. Clients use the API to discover and connect to
these Rendezvous Sockets to exchange requests. The
plutonManager's role is to create these Rendezvous Sockets and to
manage the service instances. In summary:

<ul>
<li>
Services and their Rendezvous Sockets are created for each configured
service

<p>
<li>When a client makes a set of requests to services, the client API
discovers the corresponding Rendezvous Sockets via the Lookup Table
and asynchronously connects to each service to exchange the requests

<p>
<li>Services exchange requests via the service API which in turn exchanges
them via the Rendezvous Socket

<p>
<li>The client and service APIs co-operate to ensure that timeouts on
either side of the exchange do not stall indefinitely

<p>
<li>The service API periodically writes performance data to the
plutonManager via the Reporting Socket. In turn the plutonManager uses
this data to determine the appropriate number of instances and to
log aggregate statistics so you can conduct trend analysis.

</ul>

Almost all of this is completely transparent to the application
programs and is only relevant to the APIs and the plutonManager.

<a name=Serialization>
<h3>Application Serialization</h3>
</a>

The reader may be curious as to why no mention has thus far been made
about the format of the data exchanged between clients and
services. There is a reason for this: the Pluton Framework is
serialization agnostic.

<p>
While the client and service APIs use a light-weight serialization to
exchange the request data and context, the nature of the request data
is entirely a matter for the application.  Looking at this from a
layering perspective, the Pluton Framework is more akin to a transport
layer than a presentation layer.

<p>
Naturally clients and services need to agree on what
serializations they exchange and indeed the service key naming convention
enforces the use of a well-known serialization type. But this is
only a convention which is intended to aid understanding.

<p>
There are a number of reasons for being serialization agnostic. First,
there is no "one true serialization"; often-times an implementation
language strongly favors one serialization over all others. Second,
services may simply be proxies to remote services which already have a
well-defined serialization. Third, new serializations are invented
or introduced somewhat more frequently than might be imagined (or
desired).

<p>
Imposing a conversion to an arbitrary serialization in these
circumstances seems counter-productive - particularly as many
conversions such as JSON to XML to JSON are not reliably reversible.

<p>
Agnosticism has a consequence, of course. Namely that application
programmers remain responsible for choosing their own serialization
and services normally need to verify requests against the agreed
serialization. The choice of serialization is often not easy to make
and the wrong choice can impose significant functional and performance
constraints. The Pluton Framework absolves itself of any
responsibility in this regard.

<a name=Benefits>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
</a>
So what does this framework give us? Apart for simple parallel
processing, the key feature is that the client application is isolated
from the vagaries of the service implementation. This isolation
affords a panoply of benefits:

<ul>
<li>Language independence - the client application could be written in
PHP and the service could be written in, say, Java.

<p><li>Bug isolation - if the service has bugs, then the client is fully
insulated from problems such as random memory corruption.

<p><li>Resource leak isolation - if a service is leaking a resource,
say, memory or file descriptors, the client is insulated from these
lost resources.

<p><li>Increased application stability - a failing service no longer
implies a failing client application. The client can safely detect
service failure and respond accordingly.

<p><li>Easier resource monitoring - each service instance is resource
monitored by the plutonManager. This means accurate resource and
latency costs can be determined for each type of service. Importantly,
trends can be identified with new releases of a service.

<p><li>Easier unit testing and regression testing of
services - depending on how the services is started, the service API
runs in one of two modes. In <em>manager mode</em> the service is run as
a process controlled by the plutonManager. In <em>stand-alone mode</em>
the service is run just like any other executable from a shell script
or the command-line, with requests and responses being supplied via
fd3 and fd4 respectively.
<p>
In <em>stand-alone mode</em> running a service regression
test can be as easy as re-directing a request file to the service program
and re-directing the service response to an output file for comparison.

<p>
Here is an example of a regression test which runs the service
in <em>stand-alone</em> mode:

<center>
<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

/somepath/myservice 3&lt;inputRequest 4&gt;actualResponse
cmp -s expectedResponse actualResponse && echo Success || echo Failure
</pre>
</table>
</center>

<p>Hopefully the simplicity speaks for itself.

<p><li>Easier prototyping - a service can first be implemented in an
quick-to-write language and subsequently re-written in a
quick-to-execute language as needed.

<p><li>Less disruptive installations - a service executable can be
upgraded or replaced completely transparently to the client
application. In other words, client applications can benefit from
a newly installed service executable without needing to re-start.
</ul>

<p>
In general, the goal is to help you follow the Unix maxim of writing
programs which "do one thing well", then mix and match them to suit.

<a name=Performance>
<h3>Performance</h3>

The Pluton Framework comes at a cost. Each service request involves
connecting to a Unix socket and exchanging request and response data
between processes. Looking at just the raw cost of those exchanges,
without including any application and service overhead - such as
serialization - suggests that a single modern CPU (circa 2006) can
execute around 8,000 medium-sized exchanges per second. The rate is
linear to the size of the request and response data.

<p>
Put another way, if your web application accepts, say, 100 requests
per second and averages 5 service requests per web request, the raw
overhead approximates 5*100/8000ths of your CPU, or about 6%. On the
commonly deployed hyper-threaded, dual CPU server, this overhead
reduces to around 2% of aggregate CPU capacity.

<p>On a more positive note, due to the ease of parallelization, the
Pluton Framework is especially suited to the trend towards multi-core,
multi-cpu systems.

<p>
While this level of overhead seems tolerable, be warned that the total
overhead is usually dominated by the type of application serialization
used and the size and complexity of the data exchanged.
