<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: Service Configuration</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Service Keys are the naming mechanism by which clients address a
service. The format is a dot separated set of components, ie:

<pre>
	<a href=serviceKey.html>Application.Function.Version.Serialization</a>
</pre>

<p>Service Key names are also used to name configuration files as the
<code>plutonManager</code> scans the configuration directory for files
with names which match this Service Key syntax and parses the contents
as configuration files. All other file names are ignored.

<p>Each configuration file represents a single service and the
contents of the configuration file are described in this document.

<h4><a name=GeneralSyntax>General Configuration File Syntax</h4>

Configuration files are text files and have simple syntactic rules:

<ol>
<li>Each line is self-contained
and contains a single parameter name separated by white-space and a
parameter value followed by an optional comment.

<li>Parameters can be in any order

<li>Parameter names must match exactly those defined

<li>Valid parameter values are numbers, a boolean or a string

<li>A number is an integer amenable to <code>strtol()</code>

<li>Numbers can be suffixed with K, M or G to indicate Kilo, Mega or
Giga multipliers respectively

<li>A boolean can be either 'true' or 'false'

<li>A string is all characters from the first non-whitespace to the
last non-whitespace.

<li>Quotes have no special meaning

<li>A comment is signified by the '#' character - characters from the
'#' to the end of the line are treated as whitespace

<li>There is <i>no</i> continuation syntax - each line is self-contained

<li>If a syntax error is detected, the configuration file is ignored

<li>If a semantic error is detected, the configuration file is ignored.
</ol>

<h4><a name=Samples>Sample Configurations</h4>

<p>
Here is a sample configuration file with all possible parameters in
alphabetical order:
<p>

<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
cd			.
enable-leak-ramping	true
exec			/usr/local/bin/ser45 -f /tmp/file1 -x
exit			0		# A no-op - useful for shell testing
exec-failure-backoff	60		# If fork/exec is failure - throttle for x seconds
idle-timeout		600		# Exit if service instance idle for this long
maximum-processes	10
maximum-requests	1000
maximum-retries		1		# Retry a request to another service instance
minimum-processes	1
occupancy-percent	50
prestart-services	false
recorder-cycle		0
recorder-prefix		record.
ulimit-cpu-milliseconds	0		# per request amortized across maximumRequests
ulimit-data-memory	0M		# if zero, don't apply
ulimit-open-files	0
unresponsive-timeout	10		# seconds
</pre>
</table>

<p>
A minimalist configuration file looks like this:
<p>

<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
exec			/usr/local/bin/ser45 -g -s 23 -D /tmp
</pre>

</table>

<p>
A configuration file which doubles as a runnable shell script looks
like this:
<p>

<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh
cd			/some/place
exec			/usr/local/bin/ser45
exit			13			# Exec failed

ulimit-cpu-milliseconds 100
</pre>

</table>

<p>Note the use of the no-op <code>exit</code> parameter to identify
when the <code>exec</code> fails. This can be a useful indicator for
automated regression tests.

<h4><a name=Parameters>Configuration Parameters</h4>

This section describes all of the service configuration
parameters. All parameters apply to the particular service. There is
no interaction between different service configurations. In general,
services are oblivious of each other.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th width=20%>Name<th>Type<th>Description</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=affinity-timeout>affinity-timeout</a><td>Number

<td>Maximum number of seconds to retain an affinity connection. A
client can hold on to an affinity connection indefinitely and thus
stop services from being available for other clients. This timeout
protects against a client holding onto a service indefinitely.

<p>In general, affinity connections should be avoided unless
absolutely necessary as injudicious use can only diminish the benefits
of the Pluton Framework.

<p>Default: 60, Minimum Allowed: 10, Maximum Allowed: 600</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=cd>cd</a><td>String

<td>Change to this directory prior to starting the service. If not
present, the service is started in the same directory as the
<code>plutonManager</code>.
<p>Default: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=enable-leak-ramping>enable-leak-ramping</a><td>Boolean

<td>If <code>true</code>, apply a <i>ramping</i> function to
<code>maximum-requests</code>. The effect being that different
services instance have a different notion of their maximum number of
requests and consequently exit after a varying number of requests
relative to each other.

<p>The idea is that memory leaks can be more easily detected if the
service instance exits after a varying number of requests. If the exit
memory size is constant across the different ranges, then a leak is
unlikely. If the exit memory size grows with the number of requests,
ie, a <i>ramp-up</i> in requests results in a corresponding
<i>ramp-up</i> in memory usage, then a leak should be suspected.

<p>The <code>plutonManager</code> has an option to log the exit
resources, including memory, of a service instance.

<p>Default: false</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=exec>exec<td>String

<td>The command to execute as the service with
<code>execv()</code>. Command line options and parameters - if any -
are separated by spaces. Tokenizing the command-line parameters used a
simple white-space parser. If you need a sophisticated startup
environment, quoting or other specialized syntax, you may want to
consider a shell wrapper that ultimately execs the service program.

<p>If the <code>exec</code> command is a script or program which in
turn executes another program, it is important to know that the
<code>plutonManager</code> relies on knowing the process id of the
service it execs. The implication, particularly for shell scripts, is
that the final command <b>must be</b> run with an <code>exec</code> command
so that the final process ID is the same one that the
<code>plutonManager</code> started and is monitoring.


<p>This is the only mandatory parameter. Default: None.</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=exec-failure-backoff>exec-failure-backoff<td>Number

<td>If an exec fails or exits non-zero for whatever reason, do not attempt another exec
of this service for this many seconds.

<p>The theory is, if the error is permanent and likely requires human
intervention then issuing numerous fork/execs that will fail is
pointless. As a consequence, service programs need to be careful about
non-zero exits.

<p>While the minimum value allowed is zero, it
is <bold>strongly</blod> recommended that you never set this parameter
to zero unless you clearly appreciate the implication that this may
result in the manager issuing a deleteriously large number of forks
that fail very quickly and cause undue load on your system.

<p>Default: 60, Minimum Allowed: 0, Maximum Allowed: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=exit>exit<td>Number

<td>This parameter is a no-op parameter which happens to be useful if
you want to run the configuration file as a script while testing.

<p>Default: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=idle-timeout>idle-timeout<td>Number

<td>
This parameter only applies to services that are not processing any
requests. If the service is at all active, then only the
<code>occupancy-percent</code> parameter applies.
<p>
If no processes for the service report processing any requests in this
number of seconds, then processes that are idle for at least this many
seconds are notified to exit.

<p>This parameter only affects processes in excess of the
<code>minimum-processes</code> parameter.

<p>Default: 120, Minimum Allowed: 10, Maximum Allowed: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=maximum-processes>maximum-processes<td>Number

<td>The maximum number of instances that the
<code>plutonManager</code> will ever run concurrently for a given service.

<p>This is one of the few parameters where the default is likely to
require adjustment as the choosing the optimal concurrency requires
knowledge of the cost and frequency of requests to this service plus
knowledge of available system resources.

<p>Setting this value large can have a deleterious affect on the
system.

<p>Default: 10, Minimum Allowed: 1, Maximum Allowed: 10,000</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=maximum-requests>maximum-requests<td>Number

<td>The maximum number of requests each instance will process prior to
exiting. If <code>ulimit-cpu-milliseconds</code> is being used to
protect against run-away CPU usage, <code>maximum-requests</code>
should be set to a more modest amount than the default.

<p>This value <bold>must</bold> be greater than zero.

<p>Default: 10,000, Maximum Value: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=maximum-retries>maximum-retries<td>Number

<td><font color=red>WARNING: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.</font>

<p>The maximum number of automatic retries to attempt if a request
fails to complete. Client's can over-ride automatic retry attempts by
setting the <code>pluton::noRetryAttr</code> attribute for a request.

<p>This parameter applies to requests that do not complete. It does
not apply to requests that complete with a fault.

<p>The theory is that services have bugs and that they crash for
essentially two reasons. Either the request they are processing is
triggering the bug or some "previous state" in conjunction with the
request is triggering the bug.

<p>In the latter case, retrying the request with another instance is
likely to succeed as the "previous state" is unlikely to be
pervasive. This encourages increasing the maximum number of retries.

<p>In the former case, retries will cause the service to crash. This
encourages decreasing the maximum number of retries.

<p>Default: 1, Maximum Value: 10</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=maximum-threads>maximum-threads<td>Number

<td>The maximum number of threads (pseudo or otherwise) that each
service process can start. This parameter is primarily intended for
tools that are built with the manager. A service must register that it
is threaded when this parameter is present in the configuration. User
services do not have access to the API for registering as a threaded
service so this parameter is never used by regular services.

<p>This parameter is used by a threaded service to indicate how many
threads to start to service requests. It is also used to size the
shared memory scoreboard structure.

<p>Default: 1, Maximum Value: 10,000</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=minimum-processes>minimum-processes<td>Number

<td>The <code>plutonManager</code> keeps at least this many instances
running. There is one situation where the <code>plutonManager</code>
will let the number of service processes go below this value.

<p>The situation is if the fork/exec sequence is failing or the
process is exiting non-zero for some reason. In this case the creation
of new processes is rate limited by <code>exec-failure-backoff</code>
which <i>may</i> result in less services than
<code>minimum-processes</code>.

<p>Default: 1, Maximum Value: not greater than maximum-processes</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=occupancy-percent>occupancy-percent<td>Number

<td>The <code>plutonManager</code> adjusts the number of instances to
average this percentage of occupancy across all instances. You can
think of this as a utilization percent. The <code>plutonManager</code>
uses a hysteresis and a sample period to damp instance flapping.

<p>Occupancy and concurrency correlate in this context. If
you need better concurrency at the cost of more instances, then
occupancy should be set lower. If the preference is for less
concurrency and fewer instances, concurrency should be set higher.

<p>Regardless of the configured occupancy, the outcome of the
occupancy calculations is bound by the <code>minimum-processes</code>
and <code>maximum-processes</code> configuration parameters.


<p>Default: 70, Maximum Value: 100</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=prestart-processes>prestart-processes<td>Boolean

<td>If <code>true</code> the <code>minimum-processes</code> are started
as soon as the service configuration is loaded. If <code>false</code>
starting the <code>minimum-processes</code> is deferred until the
first request is made to this service.

<p>Default: false</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=recorder-cycle>recorder-cycle<td>Number

<td>The serviceAPI has the ability to write (or record) each request
and response to a file. These files are very useful for constructing
regression tests and debugging services. To protect against unlimited
consumption of disk space, this parameter defines the maximum number
of recorder files to create. Once this limit is reached, the
serviceAPI cycles through the same set of file names, over-writing
earlier files. If this parameter is zero, no recorder files are
created.

<p>Default: 0, Maximum Value: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=recorder-prefix>recorder-prefix<td>String

<td>As mentioned above, the serviceAPI can record requests and
response to a set of files. The presence of this parameter turns on
that recording and also defines the path to use to construct the file
names.

<p>Default: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a
name=ulimit-cpu-milliseconds>ulimit-cpu-milliseconds<td>Number

<td>To protect against run-away services, this parameter can be used
to constrain the maximum amount of CPU a service can consume. This
value represents the CPU milliseconds per request and is multiplied by
<code>maximum-requests</code> to create a value suitable for the
<code>setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU)</code> system call.

<p>Since <code>setrlimit(RLIMIT_CPU)</code> applies to the life-time
of the process, it makes sense to set <code>maximum-requests</code> to
a relatively small value, say, 500, to capture the run-away process
before it consumes a large amount of CPU. For example, setting
<code>maximum-requests</code> to 10,000 and setting
<code>ulimit-cpu-milliseconds</code> to 1,000 is close to useless as
the process will consume 10,000 CPU seconds or nearly 3 CPU hours
before the ulimit value will apply. Having said that, setting any
upper value is better than no limit. If in doubt you should apply a
limit and watch the <code>plutonManager</code> logs for limit errors.

<p>If either <code>ulimit-cpu-milliseconds</code> or
<code>maximum-requests</code> is zero, then no ulimit is set.

<p>Default: 0, Maximum Value: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=ulimit-data-memory>ulimit-data-memory<td>Number

<td>To protect against a service leaking memory, this parameter can be
used to set the maximum amount of memory a service can allocate. This
parameter represents the number of megabytes set by
<code>setrlimit(RLIMIT_DATA)</code>. If this parameter is zero, no
limit is set.

<p>Default: 0, Maximum Value: none</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=ulimit-open-files>ulimit-open-files<td>Number

<td>To protect against a service leaking file descriptors, this
parameter can be used to set the maximum number of file descriptors a
service can have open. If this parameter is zero, no limit is set.

<p>When setting this parameter, keep in mind that a process often
consumes 5-10 file descriptors simply as part of the start-up process
when loading dynamic libraries and the like. Furthermore, a service
instance inherits a number of file descriptors from the
<code>plutonManager</code>. As a general rule, you should assume that
10 file descriptors are needed just to start a service and have it
accept requests.

<p>Setting this value higher than needed increases the risk of a
resource leak in a service affecting the overall system.

<p>Default: 0, Maximum Value: 1,000</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><a name=unresponsive-timeout>unresponsive-timeout<td>Number

<td>To protect against a service stalling, this parameter can be used
to set the maximum number of seconds allowed for a service to
respond. If a service instance does not respond within this time, the
<code>plutonManager</code> kills the instance.

<p>This parameter is unrelated to the timeout value used by the
clientAPI excepting that it obviously should be larger, preferably
significantly larger. If this parameter is zero, no checking is done.

<p>For efficiency reasons, the manager uses a course-grained timer
  when monitoring for an unresponsive service so typically a service
  will need to be unresponsive for a number of seconds longer than the
  configured value. In general though, this parameter is intended to
  catch a service that is never going to return, so plus or minus a
  couple of seconds of granularity is not going to make any
  difference in that regard.

<p>Default: 10, Minimum Value: 5, Maximum Value: 600</tr>
