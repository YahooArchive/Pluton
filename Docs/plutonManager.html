<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: plutonManager</h2>

The plutonManager, in conjunction with the <a
href=clientAPI.html>Client API</a> and <a href=serviceAPI.html>Service
API</a>, constitute the core of the Pluton Framework.

<p>
The plutonManager is responsible for creating all the run-time
components of each configured service. This includes the shared memory
Lookup Table, the per-service Rendezvous Socket, the per-service
service shared memory and the service processes to accept requests.

<p>The <code>plutonManager</code> is
normally run as a <a href=cr.yp.to/daemontools.html>daemontools supervised</a>
process.

<h4><a name=Usage>Usage</h4>

<pre>
Usage: plutonManager [-h]
                     [-C configurationDirectory] [-L lookupMap]
                     [-R rendezvousDirectory]
                     [-c commandInterface:commandPort]
                     [-d debugOptions] [-l loggingOptions]
                     [-s statisticsInterval] [-z st_stack_size]

The plutonManager manages service processes based on configuration files.

Where:

 -h   Print this usage message on STDOUT and exit(0)

 -C   Directory containing service configuration files (default: '.')
 -L   Name of shared memory lookup file (default: './lookup.map')
 -R   Directory where sockets and shared memory files are created (default: '.')

 -c   Defines the interface and port for the command line interface.

 -d   Debug options: all, child, manager, service, process, thread,
       stio, config, reportingChannel and calibrate (default: none)
 -l   Logging option: all, process, service;
       processStart, processLog, processExit and processUsage;
       serviceConfig, serviceStart and serviceExit;
       and calibrate (default: none)

 -s   Seconds between periodic statistics log entries (default: 600)
 -z   Size of the stack for each state-thread (default: 0)
</pre>

<p>
The simplest way to invoke the <code>plutonManager</code> is with no
options at all, in which case everything is contained and created in
the current working directory. This is a convenient way to test
without impacting anything (or anyone) else.

<h4><a name=ConfigurationScanning>Configuration Scanning</h4>

At startup or on receiving a SIGHUP, the <code>plutonManager</code>
scans the <code>configurationDirectory</code> for files matching the
<a href=serviceKey.html>Service Key</a> naming convention. Filenames
in the configuration directory which do not match the Service Key
convention are ignored.

<p>
Files that match the Service Key naming convention are assumed to be
<a href=configuration.html>configuration files</a> and are parsed
accordingly. If the configuration parse fails, the file is ignored
until the next scan.

<p>
If the scan finds a valid configuration file which is new, or has been
modified since the last scan, a new service is started and any
existing service is replaced.

<p>Services are replaced transparently by the
<code>plutonManager</code> as they are expected to be created and
upgraded many times during the life-time of the
<code>plutonManager</code>. In fact, the ultimate goal is to have the
<code>plutonManager</code> started just once at system boot and remain
active until the system is shut down.

<p>Transparency is primarily achieved by creating a new Rendezvous Socket
and using the <code>rename()</code> system call to atomically replace the
existing socket. Processes associated with the old Rendezvous Socket are
then notified to complete requests on the old socket and then exit. A
connecting client will either get the old service or the new service - the
atomicity guarantee of <code>rename()</code> assures that a Rendezvous
Socket will always exist.


<h4><a name=ServiceCreation>Service Creation</h4>

<p>Each configuration file defines a unique service named the same as
the filename of the configuration file. For each of these services, the
<code>plutonManager</code> creates a Rendezvous Socket and a shared memory
mapped file in the <code>rendezvousDirectory</code> with the ".socket"
extension, and ".mmap" extension respectively, eg:

<pre>
	system.echo.0.raw.socket
	system.echo.0.raw.mmap
</pre>

The path of these files is associated with the ServiceKey in the
LookupMap so the clientAPI can <i>discover</i> them.

<p>Depending on the service configuration, the
<code>plutonManager</code> will either listen on the Rendezvous Socket
for a connect() or start instances of the service process which will
listen for a connect(). In the former case, as soon as a connect() is
detected, at least one service process is created to accept the
connection. This is an optimization that avoids starting a service at
all. It may be appropriate for services that are rarely, if ever,
used.

<p>Once at least one service instance is started, the
<code>plutonManager</code> applies the usual scheduling algorithms in
conjunction with the configuration to manage the number of instances.


<h4><a name=ServiceDestruction>Service Destruction</h4>

If a service is to be destroyed, either because the
<code>plutonManager</code> is shutting down or because the
configuration file has been removed, essentially the reverse of the
creation process occurs; the Rendezvous Socket and shared memory
mapped files are removed and the service processes are notified to
exit.

<h4><a name=Debug>Debug Options</h4>

The debug options are normally only of use to the developer of the
<code>plutonManager</code>. These options generate verbose and obscure
output which changes with each version of the
<code>plutonManager</code>. You should not use these unless instructed
to for diagnostic purposes.

<p>All debugging output is written to STDERR.

<h4><a name=Logging>Logging Options</h4>

Compared to debug options, the logging options are intended to be
understood by everyone and some options will normally be set in a
production environment. Logging output is purposely minimalist in
nature so that it can be safely written to log files with little risk
of overloading I/O or storage capacity.

<p>Each logging option is described in the following table. There is a
specific <a href=logs.html>logs</a> page explaining in detail the
meaning of each type of log output.

<p>
<table border=1>

<tr><th>Option<th>Description</tr>

<tr valign=top><td>processStart<td>Writes a log entry each time a process is started</tr>

<tr valign=top><td>processLog<td>Writes output written by the process to STDERR -
this is the mechanism by which a service instance can add log entries
to the general log output. <br>A service should be parsimonious in its

output.</tr>

<tr valign=top><td>processExit<td>Writes a log entry each time a process exits</tr>

<p>All logging output is written to STDOUT.


<h3><a name=Signals>Signals</h3>

The <code>plutonManager</code> catches a variety of signals to manage
services and to allow external control.

In a production environment, <code>plutonManager</code> is normally
run as a <a
href=http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/supervise.html>supervised</a> process
which means you should use the <a
href=http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svc.html>svc</a> command rather than
send signals directly. The following table shows which signals are
used for what and which <code>svc</code> option, if any, should be
used:


<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Signal<th>svc option<th>Purpose</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGTERM</b><td align=center>-t<td>Initiates a shutdown. If
supervised, the service will restart.</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGINT</b><td align=center>-i<td>Forces a
    Configuration Directory scan and a reload of all discovered services</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGUSR1</b><td align=center>N/A<td>Currently initiates a shutdown, but may be
used for something different in the future</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGUSR2</b><td align=center>N/A<td>Currently initiates a shutdown, but may be
used for something different in the future</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGCHLD</b><td align=center>N/A<td>Used to detect service exits</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGPIPE</b><td align=center>N/A<td>Disables EPIPE errno returns</tr>

<tr valign=top><td><b>SIGHUP</b><td align=center>-h<td>Causes a Configuration Directory scan for
changed services</tr>

</table>


<h3><a name=Calibration>Service Calibration</h3>

A core function of the plutonManager is to calibrate - that is to say, dynamically
adjust - the number of process running at any time. A different
calibration algorithm is used depending on which phase a service is
in. The three phases are <em>Start Up</em>, <em>Active</em> and
<em>Idle</em>.

<h4><a name=CalibrationStartUp>Start Up Phase</h4>

When a service is first started due to configuration discovery, the
plutonManager will either listen on the Rendezvous Socket itself, or
start up the minimum configured services. The parameters

<a href=configuration.html#minimum-processes>minimum-processes</code></a>
and
<a href=configuration.html#prestart-spares>prestart-spares</code></a>
control this behavior.

Once the minimum number of processes have been started, the
<code>plutonManager</code> will maintain at least this many processes
so long as the service is active.

<h4><a name=CalibrationActive>Active Phase</h4>

Each service instance provides activity information to the
plutonManager, both via a shared memory segment and via status reports
written to a reporting socket. The <code>plutonManager</code> uses
this information primarily to calculate service occupancy. Occupancy is
simply the amount of time a service is <em>active</em> versus the
amount of time it is idle.

<p>The definition of <em>active</em> is the wall-clock time between the
<code>service::getRequest()</code> call and the
<code>service::sendResponse()</code>. All other time consumed by the
service instance is considered
idle time.

<p>
Represented as a pecentage, the calculated occupancy is compared to
the

<a href=configuration.html#occupancy-percent>occupancy-percent</code></a>

configuration value to determine whether a new service instance should
be started or, alternatively whether there are too many instances and
one should be stopped.

<p>

To stop a service from <em>flapping</em> - that is to say, continuously
stopping and starting because occupancy is oscillating around the
configured value - the plutonManager uses a simple hysteresis
to ensure that the occupancy change is a trend over a sample period of
around 10-15 seconds (the exact period is influenced by the arrival
rate of service reports).

<h5><a name=CalibrationBursts><em>"Bursty"</em> Requests confuse Occupancy</h5>

The occupancy algorithm assumes a relatively smooth distribution of
requests over time. On an active system with many requests per second,
this is generally true, however the activity profile may be very
<em>bursty</em> due to the nature of the application. In these cases,
it is likely the occupancy algorithm will tend not to start sufficient
instances to provide sufficient concurrency.

<p>
An example where this situation can arise is, say, when a large number of
service requests arrive at the same time, persist for a second  or so, then
do not arrive again for another 15-20 seconds. From an occupancy
perspective, the use of such a service is low, but from a concurrency
perspective, there may be insufficient services.
<p>
The best strategy for dealing with <em>bursty</em> requests that
require better response times is to ensure that there are always a
minimum number of services available with the

<a href=configuration.html#minimum-services>minimum-services</code></a>

configuration parameter.

<h5><a name=CalibrationDeveloper>Developer testing can appear <em>bursty</em></h5>

A common case where the occupancy algorithm may <em>appear</em> not to
work is when a developer is testing a service - perhaps with
small bursts of parallel requests.

<p>
In this scenario, a developer typically goes through an edit, compile,
test cycle that effectively mimics a <em>bursty</em> request
profile. The result being that parallel requests submissions by a
client are not run in parallel simply because the occupancy over time
is too low to trigger the creation of sufficient service instances.

<p>This <em>apparent</em> failure of occupancy should not be confused
with how the algorithm will work on a busy system with many
requests. The cure for this is the same as for other <em>bursty</em>
traffic profiles; use the
<a
href=configuration.html#minimum-services>minimum-services</code></a>

configuration parameter to ensure you have enough concurrent service
instances to ensure parallel execution.

<h4><a name=CalibrationIdle>Idle Phase</h4>

A service transitions to the <em>Idle</em> Phase when the
<code>plutonManger</code> detects a completely inactive service. The
definition of an inactive service is one which does not write any
performance reports for at least <code>idle-timeout</code> seconds.

<p>Once a service is transitioned to the <em>Idle</em> Phase, the
<code>plutonManager</code> will reduce the number of available
processes down to the
<code>minimum-processes</code> value.

<h3><a name=CommandPort>Command Port</h3>

If the <code>-c</code> option is present, the
<code>plutonManager</code> accepts connections on this address which
can be used to send various status and change commands to the running
instance of the <code>plutonManager</code>.

<p>The usual way to use the command port is via telnet. For security
reasons, the command port is normally bound to a localhost address to
constrain access to those who can log into the server.

<p>The command port is currently designed to be a human interface, as
  such, the interface may change without notice. In fact, the
  long-term goal is to make the command-port a programmable interface
  that is only accessed via a command-line program.
