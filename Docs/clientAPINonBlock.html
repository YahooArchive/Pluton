<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: Non-Blocking Client API</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The blocking <a href=clientAPI.html>client API</a> is designed for
simple, procedural programs that want to gain the benefits of parallel
processing without having to resort to threads, I/O events,
asynchronous I/O or other complex programming techniques.

<p>
However, the standard pluton client blocking APIs do not suit more
complex programs that are non-blocking by design. Typically such
non-blocking programs are written around asynchronous I/O event
interfaces such as <code>poll()</code>, <code>select()</code> and
<code>kqueue()</code> system calls. Alternatively, they use an
asynchronous library that encapsulates these lower level interfaces.

<p>Two notable and exceptional powerful asynchronous encapsulation
libraries are <a href=http://state-threads.sourceforge.net/>State
Threads</a> and
<a href=http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>libevent</a>.

<p>It is these two libraries that motivated the development of the
non-blocking pluton interfaces described herein. While the non-blocking
pluton client APIs are designed explicitly for use with both of these
libraries, they are amenable to many other forms of non-blocking use
as well.

<p>
The State Threads style of support is particularly simply and requires
making just one additional initialization call to identify a proxy
procedure for the <code>poll()</code> system call. Once the proxy is
identified, the <a href=clientAPI.html>client API</a> is called in the
usual way and reaps the benefits of the State Thread parallel I/O
model.

<p>
The event style of support is more complicated as the interfaces
have to exchange event requests and responses. Furthermore, the
method by which completed requests are made available to the client
are, by necessity, different as calls to the
<code>pluton::client::executeAndWait*()</code> family are fundamentally
incompatible with the event model.

<h2><a name=stateThreads>State Threads style of interface</h2>

The State Threads style of interface uses the
blocking <a href=clientAPI.html#construction><code>pluton::client()</code></a>
class in the usual way with just one additional initialization
requirement and one application reentrancy constraint.

<p>
(A complete <a href=sampleProxyClient.cc.txt>sample program</a> is
available for you to use as a template for getting started.)


<h4>Additional Initialization Requirement</h4>
<p>
The one additional requirement is that the application must
call <code>
pluton::client::setPollProxy()
</code> to identify the replacement method for
the <code>poll(2)</code> system call used by the client
library. Normally this will be <code>st_poll()</code> though
alternatives are possible if the identified method has the same
semantics.

<p>
A consequence of making the call to <code>
pluton::client::setPollProxy()
</code> is that instead of
the <code>pluton::client::executeAndWait*()</code> family making
calls to <code>poll(2)</code>, they call your supplied
procedure which must implement the same semantics and interface signature
as <code>st_poll()</code> (which is <em>almost</em> identical
to <code>poll()</code>).

<p>If you are actually using State Threads then the best proxy
procedure to supply is obviously <code>st_poll()</code>. You are not
bound to do this of course, but it is strongly recommended ... and
it's easiest to do.



<h4>Application Reentrancy Constraint</h4>

The consequence of setting the <code>poll(2)</code> proxy method is
that multiple State Threads can <i>enter</i> the client library
concurrently. Ergo, the client library needs to be re-entrant safe.

<p>It turns out that the client library <i>is</i> re-entrant safe, but
only if the application follows the following rules:

<ul>
<li>Each thread <i>must</i> create and use its
  own <code>pluton::client</code> object
<li>Each thread <i>must</i> create and use its
  own <code>pluton::clientRequest</code> objects.
</ul>


<h4><a name=setPollProxy>pluton::client::setPollProxy()</h4>

This method identifies the procedure to use in place of the
<code>poll(2)</code> system call normally used by the pluton client
library.

<p>The affect of this call is global (in spite of it being a
  per-instance based call) so it applies to
  all <code>pluton::client</code> objects in the program.

 The call
<i>should</i> be made prior to any other calls to the client library.


<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

<pre>
    #include &lt;pluton/client.h&gt;

    typedef int (*poll_handler_t)(struct pollfd *fds, int nfds, unsigned long long timeoutMicroSeconds);

    pluton::poll_handler_t setPollProxy(pluton::poll_handler_t);

</pre>

The <code>poll_handler_t</code> typedef is defined in &lt;pluton/client.h&gt; and
is shown here for discussion purposes. The signature of <code>poll_handler_t</code>
is purposely identical to <code>st_poll()</code> so that the
initialization can be as simple as:

<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
#include &lt;st.h&gt;

#include &lt;pluton/client.h&gt;

st_init();			// Init state threads

pluton::client	C;		// Create a base instance
C.setPollProxy(st_poll);	// set the poll(2) replacement
C.initialize();			// Init the pluton::client
    ...
</pre>
</table>
</center>

<p>
If you plan on providing a proxy procedure other than
<code>st_poll()</code>, note carefully that the <code>timeout</code>
parameter is an <code>unsigned long long</code> <em>microseconds</em>;
consistent with <code>st_poll()</code> rather than an <code>int</code>
milliseconds; consistent with <code>poll()</code>.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>
(It's an historical design accident, but the call to <code>
pluton::client::setPollProxy()
</code> is a per-instance call even though the effects are global. Once
the <code>poll(2)</code> proxy has been identified it applies to
<i>all</i> <code>pluton::client</code> instances - both existing and
yet-to-be-created ones.. The method should have been defined as a
static. Oh well.)
</table>

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Name<th>Description</tr>

<tr><td>poll_handler_t<td>A procedure that accepts parameters
identical to <code>st_poll()</code> and performs identical
semantics. If NULL, revert to using the <code>poll(2)</code> system call.

<tr><td>struct pollfd *fds<td>Identical to <code>poll(2)</code> and <code>st_poll()</code>.</tr>
<tr><td>int nfds<td>Identical to <code>poll(2)</code> and <code>st_poll()</code>.</tr>
<tr><td>timeout<td>Timeout in <em>microseconds</em>. This value will
always be greater than zero.</tr>
<tr><td>int return<td>Identical to <code>poll(2)</code> and <code>st_poll()</code>.</tr>


</table>

<p>
<h5>RETURN VALUE</h5>

Returns the previous <code>poll(2)</code> proxy procedure or NULL if
none has been previously set.

<h2><a name=event>Event Interface</h2>

Supporting the event model familiar to those who use <a
href=http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>libevent</a> requires a
different interface to the procedural oriented one of state threads and
the blocking client API.

<p>In the event model, the application must exchange event requests
and responses with the client API and test for completed requests. To
ensure that there is no confusion between the procedure oriented,
block-like interfaces, the event interface uses a different
<code>#include</code> and a different class name to help protect
against accidental mixing of the models.

<p>Three key differences between this event interface and other
  interfaces are:

<ol>
<li>The event interface <i>never</i> issues any I/O of any sort
  without being assured that the request will not block
<li>Each request is processed independently of other requests and has
  its own timeout value
<li>The event interface has been designed to work
  for <a href=threading.html>threaded programs</a> with a modest set
  of constraints
</ol>

<p>
<h3><a name=threadInteraction>Interaction with threaded programs</h3>

The Event Interface is designed to be compatible with threaded
programs. As such, developers should read
how <a href=threading.html>thread support</a> has been implemented in
the pluton client library. Of particular interest are the
<a href=threading.html#Rules>rules</a> regarding sharing objects
between threads.

<h3><a name=logicFlow>Typical logic flow</h3>

Once requests have been added to the request queue, the general logic
of a program using the event interface is to loop to:

<ul>
<li>Collect completed requests
<li>Determine outstanding I/O requests needed by <code>pluton::clientEvent</code>
<li>Issue system calls to determine which I/O requests have completed
<li>Return completed events to <code>pluton::clientEvent</code>
</ul>

until all requests have completed or timed out.

The key aspect of the event interface is that the caller gains control
when <code>pluton::clientEvent</code> wants to block and the caller is
then free to monitor other I/O requests besides those needed
by <code>pluton::clientEvent</code>.

<p>
While much of the following discussion uses examples based on
<a href=http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>libevent</a>, there is

a <a href=#sampleSelect>sample program</a> that
demonstrates <code>pluton::clientEvent</code> while also monitoring
for input on stdin.

<h3><a name=construction>Construction and initialization</h3>

The event interface uses the
<code>pluton::clientEvent</code> class in place of
<code>pluton::client</code> blocking class. The
<code>pluton::clientEvent</code> class replaces the
the blocking <code>executeAndWait*</code> calls with event fetch and
return calls.

<h4><a name=clientEvent>pluton::clientEvent()</h4>

Instantiates the object used to exchange events and requests with the
pluton client API. This object must be initialized with
<code>pluton::clientEvent::initialize()</code> prior to any other
use.

<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

<pre>
    #include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

    pluton::clientEvent(const char* yourName="");

</pre>

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Name<th>Description</tr>

<tr><td>yourName<td>If present, a C-string used for logging and
diagnostic purposes.</tr>

</table>

<h3><a name=exchangingRequests>Adding and removing requests from the execution queue</h3>

Naturally, you will want to arrange for requests to be executed by
<code>pluton::clientEvent</code>. There is just one method for adding
requests and another to remove completed requests.

<h4><a name=addRequest>pluton::clientEvent::addRequest()</h4>

The interface and semantics of this method are identical to the
blocking version of <a
href=clientAPI.html#addRequest><code>pluton::client::addRequest()</code></a>
with the addition of a timeout parameter. In the non-blocking API,
each request is executed with an independent timeout. This differs
from the blocking interface where all requests run with the same
timeout that starts with a call to the
<code>pluton::client::executeAndWait*()</code> family.

<p>The timeout value given to
<code>pluton::clientEvent::addRequest()</code> does not come into
effect until the first event for that request has been provided to the
caller via <code>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</code>.

After preparing a request with <code>setRequestData()</code> and
possibly setting attributes with <code>setAttribute</code>, the
request is ready to be added to the <code>pluton::client</code>
execution queue with
the <code>addRequest()</code> method.

<p>Once a request has been added to the queue, it must not be
changed in any way by the client until after the request
has completed. Adding requests to the <code>pluton::client</code>
queue does nothing more than inform <code>pluton::client</code> of the
existence of that request. Requests are not exchanged by calls to this
method.

<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

<pre>
    #include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

    pluton::clientEvent C;
    pluton::clientRequest R;

    bool C.addRequest(const char* serviceKey, R&, unsigned int timeoutMilliSeconds=4000);
    bool C.addRequest(const char* serviceKey, R*, unsigned int timeoutMilliSeconds=4000);

</pre>

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>


<table border=1>
<tr><th>Name<th>Description</tr>

<tr><td>serviceKey<td>The C-string containing the name of the service to send the request to
in the <code>Application.Function.Version.Serialization</code>
format.</tr>

<tr><td>R<td>The request to be added
to the execution queue.
<p>You must not change the request or the requestdata it refers
to until after completion of the request otherwise results
are guaranteed to be undefined and unpleasant.</tr>

<tr><td>timeoutMilliseconds<td>The request will be available via
<code>pluton::clientEvent::getCompletedRequest()</code> on or before
this many milliseconds have elapsed from the first event requested.</tr>
</table>

<h5>RETURN VALUE</h5>

Return true if the request is added to the queue, otherwise false is
returned. If the add fails, the request is set with a fault code.

<h4><a name=getCompletedRequest>pluton::clientEvent::getCompletedRequest()</h4>

Once a request has completed or timed out, it is made available by
this method. This method can be called at any time, including during
event exchange. It is important to call this method as completed
requests accumulate on an internal queue and consume memory unless
drained from the queue.

<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

<pre>
    #include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

    pluton::clientEvent C;

    pluton::clientRequest* R = C.getCompletedRequest();

</pre>

<h5>RETURN VALUE</h5>

A pointer to a <code>pluton::clientRequest</code> previously
added via <code>pluton::clientEvent::addRequest()</code>. If no
requests are complete, NULL is returned.

<p>Typical usage is to make repeated calls to
<code>pluton::clientEvent::getCompletedRequest</code> until NULL is returned.

<h3><a name=exchangingEvents>Exchanging event information</h3>

Exchanging event information is the way that
<code>pluton::clientEvent</code> progresses requests through the
execution process. The client API provides a single method for the
caller to determine which <em>new</em> events are of current interest to
<code>pluton::clientEvent</code> and there are three methods for the
caller to return <i>readable</i>, <i>writable</i> and <i>timeout</i>
completion events to the client API.

<p>An event requirement is supplied by
<code>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</code>
each time it is needed by the
client API and is not supplied again until after the results of that
event have been returned. In other words, each event requirement is a
<i>one-time</i> request. This suits well with the
<code>event_once()</code> routine supplied with
<a href=http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>libevent</a>.

<p>If an event is <i>lost</i> by the caller and never returned to the
client API, the corresponding <code>pluton::clientRequest</code> will
never complete or become available to the caller.

<p>In summary, don't lose events and do not return them more than
once.


<h4><a
name=getNextEventWanted>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</h4>

Whenever a request is added to the <code>pluton::clientEvent</code>
<em>and</em> after events are returned to <code>pluton::clientEvent</code>,
the caller must discover which new events are of current interest to
<code>pluton::clientEvent</code> and add those events to whatever
mechanism the caller is using to monitor events; in the case of
<code>libevent</code> that means calling <code>event_once</code>.

<p>Repeated calls should be made to
<code>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</code> until the
return indicates that no additional events are required. Generally
speaking, <code>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</code>
returns one event requirement per outstanding request, however callers
should not rely on this.

<p>The <code>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</code> method
has an optional <code>clientRequest</code> parameter which constraints
return events to just those applicable to that request. If this
parameter is not supplied or is NULL, events for all outstanding
requests are returned.

<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

Return a pointer to a <code>pluton::clientEvent::eventWanted</code> structure that describes which
event the caller should detect for the client API.

<pre>
    #include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

    enum eventType { wantRead=1, wantWrite=2 };

    typedef struct {
      eventType				type;
      int				fd;
      struct timeval			timeout;
      const pluton::clientRequest* 	clientRequestPtr;
    } eventWanted;

    pluton::clientEvent	C;

    const pluton::clientEvent::eventWanted* ewp
	= C.getNextEventWanted(const struct timeval* now, pluton::clientRequest* filter=0);
</pre>

The <code>eventType</code> and <code>eventWanted</code> definitions
are in <code>&lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;</code> and are include here for
discussion purposes.

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>


<table border=1>
<tr><th>Name<th>Description</tr>

<tr><td>struct timeval* now<td>A pointer to the current time
consistent with the <code>gettimeofday()</code> system call.</tr>

<tr><td>pluton::clientRequest* filter<td>An optional pointer to a
current request. If present, only events for that request will be
returned to the caller. Naturally requests other than this
request may not progress since the caller can never select on
them, so only use this parameter if you are sure of the consequences.</tr>

</table>

<h5>RETURN VALUE</h5>

A pointer to a <code>pluton::clientEvent::eventWanted</code> structure or NULL if
no new events are wanted. This pointer remains valid until the event
is returned. NULL is returned if there are no requests in the queue
or if all outstanding requests completed without the need for further
I/O events.

<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Name<th>Description</tr>

<tr><td>Type<td>One of the enumerated values to indicate whether a
read or write event is desired.</tr>

<tr><td>fd<td>The system file descriptor for that event. No
operations are allowed on this file descriptor excepting to detect
the event required.</tr>

<tr><td>timeout<td>How long to wait for the event to occur. A timeout
event must be returned if the timeout expires.</tr>

<tr><td>clientRequestPtr<td>A pointer to the request requiring the
event.
<p>This value is intended as a convenience for the caller and
is not an essential part of the event requirement.

</table>

<p>Expected usage of each <code>pluton::clientEvent::eventWanted</code> returned is
to call <code>event_once()</code>. Given that multiple events may be
required, a typically and optimal exchange with
<code>event_once()</code> could look like this:

<center>
<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>
#include &lt;event.h&gt;
#include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

pluton::clientEvent C;

struct timeval now;
gettimeofday(&now, 0);

const pluton::clientEvent::eventWanted* ewp;
while ((ewp = C.getNextEventWanted(&now))) {
  event_once(ewp->fd,
	     (ewp->type == pluton::clientEvent::wantRead) ? EV_READ : EV_WRITE,
	     yourEventHandler, (void*) &C, &ewp->timeout);
}
</pre>
</table>
</center>

<p>From the above fragment you can see that the caller is responsible
for supplying the event handler for <code>libevent</code> to transfer
available events into the client API. A sample showing how this is
done is shown in the next section.

<p>This of course is just one way of managing these events and many
others are possible without <code>libevent</code>, such as using the
<code>fd</code> as an index into a <code>select()</code> bitmap.

<p>One important point to note is that only two types of events are
explicitly wanted as timeout events are never requested independently
of <code>wantRead</code> or <code>wantWrite</code>.

<h4><a
name=sendEvent>
pluton::clientEvent::sendCanReadEvent(),
sendCanWriteEvent() and
sendTimeoutEvent()
</h4>

Return a completed <code>eventWanted</code> request to the client
API. This is the mechanism by which the results of
your <code>select/poll/kqueue/epoll</code> call is returned to the
client API.

<p>All three methods have identical parameters and return
values except the optional  <code>abortFlag</code> which only
applies to <code>sendTimeoutEvent</code>.
The type of event is defined by the method name. Once an fd
has been returned with one of these calls, the caller has relinquished
control should ignore this fd unless it is again
given to the caller via <code>getNextEventWanted()</code>.

<H5>Timeouts</h5>

When <code>poll()</code> or <code>select()</code> indicate a timeout,
 the caller should return all fds to the API  via
 <code>sendTimeoutEvent()</code>. Doing so does <i>not</i> mean that
 the corresponding requests have timed out. Rather it is merely a hint
 that the time budget for each request needs to be re-calculated.

<p>The reason for these semantics is that when
using <code>poll()</code> or <code>select()</code> the caller
typically uses the minimum timeout value returned by all calls
to <code>getNextEvent</code>, however the caller is free to use
whatever timeout value they deem suitable.

<p>The exception to this is if the <code>abortFlag</code>
  for <code>sendTimeoutEvent</code> is true.


<h5>SYNOPSIS</h5>

<pre>
    #include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

    pluton::clientEvent	C;

    int C.sendCanReadEvent(int fd);
    int C.sendCanWriteEvent(int fd);
    int C.sendTimeoutEvent(int fd, bool abortFlag=false);

</pre>

<h5>PARAMETERS</h5>


<table border=1>
<tr><th>Name<th>Description</tr>

<tr><td>fd<td>The file descriptor supplied by a previous call to
<code>pluton::clientEvent::getNextEventWanted()</code></tr>

<tr><td>abortFlag<td>If true, the associated request will be treated
    as timed out and will be returned on the next call
    to <code>getCompletedRequest</code>.
</tr>

</table>


<p>
<h5>RETURN VALUES</h5>

<table border=1>
<tr><td>-1<td>
The fd is not part of a current request</tr>

<tr><td>-2<td>
The fd is not part of a current request - but may have been from an
older one</tr>

<tr><td>-3<td>
The fd has no events outstanding
</tr>

<tr><td>&lt;0<td>Some other unspecified error</tr>

<tr><td>&gt;=0<td>The event has been accepted and processed
</table>

<p>For non-negative returns,
use <code>pluton::clientEvent::getCompletedRequest()</code> to consume
completed requests.

<p>
In the case of <code>libevent</code> the typical technique is to
supply an event handler with the call to <code>event_once()</code>
which transfer events back into the client API. Here is a fragment
showing one way to do this:

<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<td>
<pre>

#include &lt;event.h&gt;
#include &lt;pluton/clientEvent.h&gt;

pluton::clientEvent C;

static void
libeventHandler(int fd, short event, void* voidC)
{
  pluton::clientEvent* C = (pluton::clientEvent*) voidC;

  switch (event) {
    case EV_READ: C->sendCanReadEvent(fd); break;

    case EV_WRITE: C->sendCanWriteEvent(fd); break;

    case EV_TIMEOUT: C->sendTimeoutEvent(fd); break;
  }


  pluton::clientRequest* R;
  while ((R = C->getCompletedRequest())) ... do something
}
</pre>
</table>
</center>

<p>
Note that the fragment checks for completed requests after
transferring the event to the client API. Such checks do not have to
occur here, but typically a request will be available after an event
has been transferred.

o<h3><a name=sampleSelect>Sample program</a> using <code>select()</code></h3>

A complete <a href=sampleEventClient.cc.txt>sample program</a>
demonstrates most of the aspects of coding to the <code>event</code> interface. It
 adds requests to <code>pluton::clientEvent</code> then
  loops until those requests are completed. It demonstrates the event
  style of interface <i>without</i> using <code>libevent</code>.

<p>Importantly, this program demonstrates how to return timeouts for all file descriptors.

<p>The one thing this program does not demonstrate is applying the supplied timeout to
  the <code>select()</code> call. This aspect is left as an exercise for the reader.
