<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: Service Keys</h2>

Service Keys are the mechanism by which clients address services,
configuration files are identified and various temporary file system
objects are created (eg, Rendezvous Sockets).

Service Keys consists of dot separated set of components, i.e.:

<pre>
	Application.Function.Version.Serialization
</pre>

Historically the naming is RPC-oriented, but really,
<code>Application</code> and <code>Function</code> can just as easily
be <code>Action</code> and <code>Resource</code> - especially if you
take advantage of the lookup wildcard feature. In that case, a Service
Key could be viewed as:

<pre>
        Action.Resource.Version.Serialization
</pre>

<p>
The rules which define a valid Service Key are:

<p>
<ul>

<li>The Service Key must have exactly four components separated by a '.'

<p><li>Each component must be less than or equal to 32 characters in
length - mostly to ensure the complete name plus extensions can be created in
a Unix file system.

<p><li> The first component, called <code>Application</code> must have a
length which is greater than zero and less than or equal to 32
characters.

<p><li>The second component, called <code>Function</code> must have a
length which is less than or equal to 32
characters. <code>Function</code> can be zero length for a
configuration file to indicate a wild-card service, but must be
greater then zero when used by a client to identify a service.

<p><li>The third component, called <code>Version</code> must be a
positive decimal integer with a length in the range of 1 to 6
characters. To avoid ambiguity, leading zeroes are not allow for
versions greater than zero as this could be mis-interpreted by some to
mean octal.

<p><li>The forth and final component, called
<code>Serialization</code>, must exactly match one of the pre-defined <a
href=serialization.html>serialization types</a>.


</ul>
