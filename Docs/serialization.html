<h2 align=center>The Pluton Framework: Serialization</h2>

There are two aspects to serialization that need to be considered when
creating a new service. The character-set encoding and the data
serialization format. The serialization format is explicitly
advertised as part of the service key whereas the character-set
encoding is implicit.

<h3>Character-set encoding</h3>

The Pluton Framework makes no assumptions about serialization, nor
does it examine the exchanged data to verified or check
serialization. This means you <i>could</i> use any sort of funky
character-set and serialization format you want to and it will work so
long as the service and client agree and are capable of accepting the
data (some language interfaces have functional constraints).

<p>The problem of course is that a funky choice limits
 interoperability and re-use. For that reason, it is <u><strong>strongly
 recommended that you only every use UTF-8</strong></u> as your character encoding
 for all text based serialization types. This should also apply as
 much as possible to the <code>raw</code> type.


<h3>Serialization Format</h3>

The serialization format of the request and response is encoded in the
Service Key. Service Keys are the mechanism by which clients address a
service. The format of a Service Key is a dot separated set of
components, ie:

<pre>
	<a href=serviceKey.html>Application.Function.Version.Serialization</a>
</pre>

<p>
<code>serialization</code> is case sensitive and defines the
particular convention used to exchange
requests. <code>serialization</code> is merely a convention because
conformance is not checked by any part of the Pluton Framework. Any
checking is typically performed by application code on either side of
the exchange.

<p>The design decision to abdicate from serialization checking in the
  Pluton Framework is a
pragmatic one as it most likely duplicates work that has to be done in
clients and services anyway; particularly de-serializing to construct a
data structure. Furthermore, the degree of checking and the severity
of response is likely to vary between applications. Finally,
serialization is just one of many checks a service will want to make
on a request, having the Pluton Framework perform some of those
checks merely blurs the lines of responsibility without much gain.

<p>In summary, the Pluton Framework focuses on solving service
discovery, data exchange and parallel processing and leaves content
processing to higher layers.

<p>
A complete request consists of a client sending Context Variables and
requestData and the service responding with responseData and fault
information. Context Variables and fault information are both
independent of <code>serialization</code>; <code>serialization</code>
only applies to requestData and responseData.

<p>This table defines the valid serialization types and typically
start and end data patterns.

<p>
Serialization merely scratches the surface of an interface to a
service. A well documented service will define the semantics of the
serialized data as well any expected Context Variables and the types
of faults it can generate.
