<h2 align=center>About the Pluto-Charon Image</h2>

This <a
href=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/pluto_worldbook.html>NASA</a> image
of Pluto and Charon was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope using
the European Space Agency's <i>Faint Object Camera</i> or FOC. It is
currently one of the best images available and is unlikely to be
substantially supplanted until 2015 when the <a
href=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/>New Horizons probe</a>, launched in
January 2006, is expected to fly by Pluto en-route to the Kuiper Belt.

<p>Pluton <i>was</i> the proposed name for trans-Nepturian objects -
though geologists have long used this word to mean a body of igneous
rock. The notion of a gaggle of small planetoids revolving around a
set of central applications seems to fit with the application model
described here-in.

"New Horizons is now 1.19 billion miles (nearly 1.92 billion
kilometers) from Earth, speeding away from the Sun at just over 10
miles per second. At that distance, radio signals (traveling at light
speed) from home need an hour and 46 minutes to reach the
spacecraft."
