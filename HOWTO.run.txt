1. sudo make install

2. Start the manager - from one shell

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
   $ sh run_manager.sh

3. Send a service request with plSend/plPing - from another shell

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
   $ 
   $ plSend -n system.echo.0.raw "echo me"
   $ plPing -c 5


Notes:

o Sending a SIGINT (typically ctrl-C) from the manager terminal causes
  a configuration reload

o Sending a SIGTERM (typically ctrl-\) from the manager terminal
  causes the manager to shutdown


In a production environment, the plutonManager is designed to run as a
supervised process (see http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html)
